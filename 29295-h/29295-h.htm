</div>
<div class="unindent">hat's Geoff, I'm sure," said Elsa; "I always
know his ring. I do hope&mdash;&mdash;" and she
stopped and sighed a little.</div>

<p>"What?" said Frances, looking up quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing particular. Run down, Vic, dear, and get
Geoff to go straight into the school-room. Order his tea
at once. I <i>don't</i> want him to come upstairs just now.
Mamma is so busy and worried with those letters."</p>

<p><img class="left" src="images/image003c.jpg" width="150" alt="VICKY" />Vic, a little girl of nine, with long fair hair and long
black legs, and a pretty face with a bright, eager
expression, needed no second bidding. She was off
almost before Elsa had finished speaking.</p>

<p>"What a good child she is!" said Frances. "What
a clever, nice boy she would have made! And if
Geoff had been a girl, perhaps he would have been more easily managed."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Elsa. "Perhaps if Vicky had been a boy she
would have been spoilt and selfish too."</p>

<p>"Elsa," said Frances, "I think you are rather hard upon Geoff. He
is like all boys. Everybody says they are more selfish than girls, and
then they grow out of it."</p>

<p>"They grow out of showing it so plainly, perhaps," replied Elsa,
rather bitterly. "But you contradict yourself, Frances. Just a moment
ago you said what a much nicer boy Vic would have made. All boys
aren't like Geoff. Of course, I don't mean that he is really a bad boy;
but it just comes over me now and then that it is a <i>shame</i> he should be
such a tease and worry, boy or not. When mamma is anxious, and with
good reason, and we girls are doing all we can, why should Geoff be the
one we have to keep away from her, and to smooth down, as it were?
It's all for her sake, of course; but it makes me ashamed, all the same,
to feel that we are really almost afraid of him. There now&mdash;&mdash;" And
she started up as the sound of a door, slammed violently in the lower
regions, reached her ears.</p>

<p>But before she had time to cross the room, Vicky reappeared.</p>

<p>"It's nothing, Elsa," the child began eagerly. "Geoff's all right;
he's not cross. He only slammed the door at the top of the kitchen stair
because I reminded him not to leave it open."</p>

<p>"You might have shut it yourself, rather than risk a noise to-night,"
said Elsa. "What was he doing at the top of the kitchen stair?"</p>

<p>Vicky looked rather guilty.</p>

<p>"He was calling to Ph&oelig;be to boil two eggs for his tea. He says he
is so hungry. I would have run up to tell you; but I thought it was
better than his teasing mamma about letting him come in to dinner."</p>

<p>Elsa glanced at Frances.</p>

<p>"You see," her glance seemed to say.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," she said aloud to the little sister, "anything is better than
that. Run down again, Vicky, and keep him as quiet as you can."</p>

<p>"Would it not be better, perhaps," asked Frances, rather timidly, "for
one of us to go and speak to him, and tell him quietly about mamma
having had bad news?"</p>

<p>"He wouldn't rest then till he had heard all about it from herself," said
Elsa. "Of course he'd be sorry for her, and all that, but he would only
show it by teasing."</p>

<p>It was Frances's turn to sigh, for in spite of her determination to see
everything and everybody in the best possible light, she knew that Elsa
was only speaking the truth about Geoffrey.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the two sisters were sitting at dinner with their
mother. She was anxious and tired, as they knew, but she did her
utmost to seem cheerful.</p>

<p>"I have seen and heard nothing of Geoff," she said suddenly. "Has
he many lessons to do to-night? He's all right, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Frances. "Vic's with him, looking out his words. He
seems in very good spirits. I told him you were busy writing for the
mail, and persuaded him to finish his lessons first. He'll be coming up
to the drawing-room later."</p>

<p>"I think mamma had better go to bed almost at once," said Elsa,
abruptly. "You've finished those letters, dear, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;all that I can write as yet. But I must go to see Mr. Norris
first thing to-morrow morning. I have said to your uncle that I cannot
send him particulars till next mail."</p>

<p>"Mamma, darling," said Frances, "do you really think it's going to be
very bad?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Tudor smiled rather sadly.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so," she said; "but the suspense is the worst. Once we
really <i>know</i>, we can meet it. You three girls are all so good, and Geoff,
poor fellow&mdash;he <i>means</i> to be good too."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Frances, eagerly, "I'm sure he does."</p>

<p>"But 'meaning' alone isn't much use," said Elsa. "Mamma," she
went on with sudden energy, "if this does come&mdash;if we really do lose
all our money, perhaps it will be the best thing for Geoff in the end."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tudor seemed to wince a little.</p>

<p>"You needn't make the very worst of it just yet, any way," said
Frances, reproachfully.</p>

<p>"And it would in one sense be the hardest on Geoff," said the mother,
"for his education would have to be stopped, just when he's getting on
so well, too."</p>

<p>"But<span class="norewrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>" began Elsa, but she said no more. It was no use just then
expressing what was in her mind&mdash;that getting on well at school, winning
the good opinion of his masters, the good fellowship of his companions,
did not comprise the whole nor even the most important part of the duty
of a boy who was also a son and a brother&mdash;a son, too, of a widowed
mother, and a brother of fatherless sisters. "I would almost rather," she
said to herself, "that he got on less well at school if he were more of a
comfort at home. It would be more manly, somehow."</p>

<p>Her mother did not notice her hesitation.</p>

<p>"Let us go upstairs, dears," she said. "I <i>am</i> tired, but I am not going
to let myself be over-anxious. I shall try to put things aside, as it were,
till I hear from Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot. I have the fullest confidence in
his advice."</p>

<p>"I wish he would take it into his head to come home," said
Frances.</p>

<p>"So do I," agreed her mother.</p>

<p>They were hardly settled in the drawing-room before Vic appeared.</p>

<p>"Elsa," she whispered, "Geoff sent me to ask if he may have something
to eat."</p>

<p>"Something to eat," repeated Elsa. "He had two eggs with his tea.
He can't be hungry."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;o&mdash;But there were anchovy toasts at dinner&mdash;Harvey told him.
And he's so fond of anchovy toasts. I think you'd better say he may,
Elsa, because of mamma."</p>

<p>"Very well," the elder sister replied. "It's not right&mdash;it's always the
way. But what are we to do?"</p>

<p>Vicky waited not to hear her misgivings, but flew off. She was well-drilled,
poor little soul.</p>

<p>Her brother was waiting for her, midway between the school-room and
dining-room doors.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said, moving towards the latter.</p>

<p>"Yes. Elsa says you may," replied the breathless little envoy.</p>

<p>"Elsa! What has she to do with it? I told you to ask mamma, not
Elsa," he said roughly.</p>

<p>He stood leaning against the jamb of the door, his hands in his pockets,
with a very cross look on his handsome face. But Victoria, devoted little
sister though she was, was not to be put down by any cross looks
when she knew she was in the right.</p>

<p>"Geoff," she said sturdily, "I'll just leave off doing messages or anything
for you if you are <i>so</i> selfish. How could I go teasing mamma
about anchovy toasts for you when she is so worried?"</p>

<p>"How should I know she is busy and worried?" said Geoff. "What
do you mean? What is it about?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. At least I only know that Elsa and Francie told me
that she <i>was</i> worried, and that she
had letters to write for the ship that
goes to India to-morrow."</p>

<p><img class="right" src="images/image007.jpg" width="300" alt="HER_BROTHER_WAS_WAITING_FOR_HER" />"For the Indian mail you mean,
I suppose," said Geoff. "What a
donkey you are for your age, Vic!
Oh, if it's only that, she's writing to
that old curmudgeon; <i>that's</i> nothing
new. Come along, Vicky, and I'll
give you a bit of my toasts."</p>

<p>He went into the dining-room as
he spoke, and rang the bell.</p>

<p>"Harvey'll bring them up. I
said I'd ring if I was to have them.
Upon my word, Vic, it isn't every
fellow of my age that would take things so quietly. Never touching a
scrap without leave, when lots like me come home to late dinner every
night."</p>

<p>"Elsa says it's only middle-class people who let children dine late," said
Vic, primly, "<i>I</i> shan't come down to dinner till I'm <i>out</i>."</p>

<p>Geoffrey burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" he said. "Elsa finds reasons for everything that suits her.
Here, Vicky, take your piece."</p>

<p>Vicky was not partial to anchovy toasts, but to-night she was so anxious
to keep Geoff in a good humour, that she would have eaten anything he
chose to give her, and pretended to like it. So she accepted her share,
and Geoff munched his in silence.</p>

<p>He was a well-made, manly looking boy, not tall for his years, which
were fourteen, but in such good proportion as to give promise of growing
into a strong and vigorous man. His face was intended by nature to be
a very pleasing one. The features were all good; there was nobility in the
broad forehead, and candour in the bright dark eyes, and&mdash;sometimes&mdash;sweetness
in the mouth. But this "sometimes" had for long been
becoming of less and less frequent occurrence. A querulous, half-sulky
expression had invaded the whole face: its curves and lines were hardening
as those of no young face should harden; the very carriage of the boy
was losing its bright upright fearlessness&mdash;his shoulders were learning to
bend, his head to slouch forward. One needed but to glance at him to
see that Geoffrey Tudor was fast becoming that most disagreeable of
social characters, a grumbler! And with grumbling unrepressed, and
indulged in, come worse things, for it has its root in that true "root of
all evil," selfishness.</p>

<p>As the last crumbs of the anchovy toasts disappeared, Geoff glanced
round him.</p>

<p>"I say, Vic," he began, "is there any water on the sideboard? Those
things are awfully salt. But I don't know that I'm exactly thirsty, either.
I know what I'd like&mdash;a glass of claret, and I don't see why I shouldn't
have it, either. At my age it's really too absurd that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What are you talking about, Geoff?" said Elsa's voice in the doorway.
"Mamma wants you to come up to the drawing-room for a little. What
is it that is too absurd at your age?"</p>

<p>"Nothing in particular&mdash;or rather everything," said Geoff, with a slight
tone of defiance. There was something in Elsa's rather too superior, too
elder-sisterly way of speaking that, as he would have expressed it, "set
him up." "I was saying to Vic that I'd like a glass of claret, and that I
don't see why I shouldn't have it, either. Other fellows would help themselves
to it. I often think I'm a great donkey for my pains."</p>

<p>Elsa looked at him with a strange mixture of sadness and contempt.</p>

<p>"What will he be saying next, I wonder?" her glance seemed to say.</p>

<p>But the words were not expressed.</p>

<p>"Come upstairs," she said. "Vicky has told you, I know, that you
must be <i>particularly</i> careful not to tease mamma to-night."</p>

<p>Geoff returned her look with an almost fierce expression in the eyes
that could be so soft and gentle.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd mind your own business, and leave mother and me to
ourselves. It's your meddling puts everything wrong," he muttered.</p>

<p>But he followed his elder sister upstairs quietly enough. Down in the
bottom of his heart was hidden great faith in Elsa. He would, had
occasion demanded it, have given his life, fearlessly, cheerfully, for her or
his mother, or the others. But the smaller sacrifices, of his likes and dislikes,
of his silly boyish temper and humours&mdash;of "self," in short, he could
not or would not make. Still, something in Elsa's words and manner this
evening impressed him in spite of himself. He followed her into the
drawing-room, fully <i>meaning</i> to be good and considerate.</p>

</div>
<div class="unindent">hat was the worst of it&mdash;the most puzzling part of it, rather,
perhaps we should say&mdash;with Geoffrey. He <i>meant</i> to be
good. He would not for worlds have done anything that
he distinctly saw to be wrong. He worked well at his lessons, though
to an accompaniment of constant grumbling&mdash;at home, that is to say;
grumbling at school is not encouraged. He was rather a favourite with
his companions, for he was a manly and "plucky" boy, entering heartily
into the spirit of all their games and amusements, and he was thought well
of by the masters for his steadiness and perseverance, though not by any
means of naturally studious tastes. The wrong side of him was all
reserved for home, and for his own family.</div>

<p>Yet, only son and fatherless though he was, he had not been "spoilt"
in the ordinary sense of the word. Mrs. Tudor, though gentle, and in
some ways timid, was not a weak or silly woman. She had brought up
her children on certain broad rules of "must," as to which she was as firm
as a rock, and these had succeeded so well with the girls that it was a
complete surprise as well as the greatest of sorrows to her when she first
began to see signs of trouble with her boy. And gradually her anxiety
led her into the fatal mistake of spoiling Geoffrey by making him of too
much consequence. It came to be recognized in the household that his
moods and humours were to be a sort of family barometer, and that all
efforts were to be directed towards the avoidance of storms. Not that
Geoff was passionate or violent. Had he been so, things would have
sooner come to a crisis. He was simply <i>tiresome</i>&mdash;tiresome to a degree
that can scarcely be understood by those who have not experienced such
tiresomeness for themselves. And as there is no doubt a grain of the
bully somewhere in the nature of every boy&mdash;if not of every human being&mdash;what
this tiresomeness might have grown into had the Fates, or something
higher than the Fates, not interposed, it would be difficult to exaggerate.</p>

<p>The cloudy look had not left Geoff's face when he came into the
drawing-room. But, alas! it was nothing new to see him "looking like
that." His mother took no notice of it.</p>

<p>"Well, Geoff?" she said pleasantly. "How have you got on to-day,
my boy?"</p>

<p>He muttered something indistinctly, which sounded like, "Oh, all
right;" then catching sight of Elsa's reproachful face, he seemed to put
some constraint on himself, and, coming forward to his mother, kissed her
affectionately.</p>

<p>"Are you very tired to-night, mamma?" he said. "Must I not speak
to you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Tudor <i>was</i> very tired, and she knew by old experience what
Geoff's "speaking" meant&mdash;an hour or more's unmitigated grumbling, and
dragging forward of every possible grievance, to have each in turn talked
over, and sympathized about, and smoothed down by her patient hand.
Such talks were not without their effect on the boy; much that his mother
said appealed to his good sense and good feeling, though he but seldom
gave her the satisfaction of seeing this directly. But they were very
wearing to <i>her</i>, and it was carrying motherly unselfishness too far to
undertake such discussion with Geoff, when she was already worn out
with unusual anxiety.</p>

<p>She smiled, however, brightly enough, in reply to his questions. It
cheered her to see that he could consider her even thus much.</p>

<p>"Of course I can speak to you, Geoff. Have you anything particular
to tell me?"</p>

<p>"Lots of things," said the boy. He drew forward a chair in which to
settle himself comfortably beside his mother, darting an indignant glance
at his sisters as he did so. "Humbugging me as usual about mamma&mdash;anything
to keep me away from her," he muttered. But Elsa and Frances
only glanced at each other in despair.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Tudor, resignedly, leaning back in her chair.</p>

<p>"Mamma," began Geoffrey, "there must be something done about my
pocket-money. I just can't do with what I've got. I've waited to speak
about it till I had talked it over with some of the other fellows. They
nearly all have more than I."</p>

<p>"Boys of your age&mdash;surely not?" interposed Mrs. Tudor.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="images/image012.jpg" width="310" alt="THERE_MUST_BE_SOMETHING_DONE_ ABOUT_MY_POCKET-MONEY." />
"Well, <i>some</i> of them are not
older than I," allowed Geoff.
"If you'd give me more, and
let me manage things for myself&mdash;football
boots, and cricket-shoes,
and that sort of thing.
The girls"&mdash;with cutting emphasis&mdash;"are
always hinting
that I ask you for too many
things, and <i>I</i> hate to be seeming
to be always at you for something.
If you'd give me a
regular allowance, now, and let
me manage for myself."</p>

<p>"At your age," repeated his mother, "that surely is very unusual."</p>

<p>"I don't see that it matters exactly about age," said Geoff, "if one's
got sense."</p>

<p>"But have you got sense enough, Geoff?" said Frances, gently. "I'm
three years older than you, and I've only just begun to have an allowance
for my clothes, and I should have got into a dreadful mess if it hadn't
been for Elsa helping me."</p>

<p>"Girls are quite different," said Geoff. "They want all sorts of
rubbishing ribbons and crinolines and flounces. Boys only need regular
necessary things."</p>

<p>"Then you haven't any wants at present, I should think, Geoff," said
Elsa, in her peculiarly clear, rather aggravating tones. "You were
completely rigged out when you came back from the country, three weeks
ago."</p>

<p>Geoff glowered at her.</p>

<p>"Mamma," he said, "will you once for all make Elsa and Frances
understand that when I'm speaking to you they needn't interfere?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Tudor did not directly respond to this request.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me, Geoff," she said, "what has put all this into your
head? What things are you in want of?"</p>

<p>Geoff hesitated. Fancied wants, like fancied grievances, have an
annoying trick of refusing to answer to the roll-call when distinctly summoned
to do so.</p>

<p>"There's lots of things," he began. "I <i>should</i> have a pair of proper
football boots, instead of just an old common pair with ribs stuck on, you
know, like I have. All the fellows have proper ones when they're fifteen
or so."</p>

<p>"But you are not fifteen."</p>

<p>"Well, I might wait about the <i>boots</i> till next term. But I do really
want a pair of boxing-gloves dreadfully," he went on energetically, as the
idea occurred to him; "you know I began boxing this term."</p>

<p>"And don't they provide boxing-gloves? How have you managed
hitherto?" asked his mother, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, yes&mdash;there <i>are</i> gloves; but of course it's much nicer to have
them of one's own. It's horrid always to seem just one of the lot that
can't afford things of their own."</p>

<p>"And if you are <i>not</i> rich&mdash;and I dare say nearly all your schoolfellows
are richer than you"&mdash;said Elsa, "is it not much better not to sham that
you are?"</p>

<p>"Sham," repeated Geoff, roughly. "Mamma, I do think you should
speak to Elsa.&mdash;If you were a boy&mdash;&mdash;" he added, turning to his sister
threateningly. "I don't want to sham about anything; but it's very hard
to be sent to a school when you can't have everything the same as the
others."</p>

<p>A look of pain crept over Mrs. Tudor's tired face. Had she done
wrong? Was it another of her "mistakes"&mdash;of which, like all candid
people, she felt she had made many in her life&mdash;to have sent Geoff to a
first-class school?</p>

<p>"Geoff," she said weariedly, "you surely do not realize what you cause
me when you speak so. It was almost my principal reason for settling in
London seven years ago, that I might be able to send you to one of the
best schools. We could have lived more cheaply, and more comfortably,
in the country; but you would have had to go to a different class of school."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish I had, then," said Geoff, querulously. "I perfectly hate
London; I have always told you so. I shouldn't mind what I did if it
was in the country. It isn't that I want to spend money, or that I've
extravagant ideas; but it's too hard to be in a false position, as I am at
school&mdash;not able to have things like the other fellows. You would have
made <i>me</i> far happier if you had gone to live in the country and let me
go to a country school. I <i>hate</i> London; and just because I want things
like other fellows, I'm scolded."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tudor did not speak. She looked sad and terribly tired.</p>

<p>"Geoff," said Elsa, putting great control on herself so as to speak very
gently, for she felt as if she could gladly shake him, "you must see that
mamma is very tired. Do wait to talk to her till she is better able for it.
And it is getting late."</p>

<p>"Do go, Geoff," said his mother. "I have listened to what you have
said; it is not likely I shall forget it. I will talk to you afterwards."</p>

<p>The boy looked rather ashamed.</p>

<p>"I haven't meant to vex you," he said, as he stooped to kiss his mother.
"I'm sorry you're so tired."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment after he had left the room.</p>

<p>"I am afraid there is a mixture of truth in what he says," said Mrs.
Tudor, at last. "It has been one of the many mistakes I have made,
and now I suppose I am to be punished for it."</p>

<p>Elsa made a movement of impatience.</p>

<p>"Mamma dear!" she exclaimed, "I don't think you would speak that
way if you weren't tired. There isn't any truth in what Geoff says. I
don't mean that he tells stories; but it's just his incessant grumbling. He
makes himself believe all sorts of nonsense. He has everything right
for a boy of his age to have. I know there are boys whose parents are
really rich who have less than he has."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, mamma; Elsa is right," said Frances. "Geoff is
insatiable. He picks out the things boys here and there may have as an
exception, and wants to have them all. He has a perfect genius for
grumbling."</p>

<p>"Because he is always thinking of himself," said Elsa. "Mamma,
don't think me disrespectful, but would it not be better to avoid saying
things which make him think himself of such consequence&mdash;like telling
him that we came to live in town principally for <i>his</i> sake?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," said her mother. "I am always in hopes of making
him ashamed, by showing how much <i>has</i> been done for him."</p>

<p>"And he does feel ashamed," said Frances, eagerly. "I saw it
to-night; he'd have liked to say something more if he hadn't been too
proud to own that he had been inventing grievances."</p>

<p>"Things have been too smooth for him," said Elsa; "that's the truth
of it. He needs some hardships."</p>

<p>"And as things are turning out he's very likely to get them," said
Mrs. Tudor, with a rather wintry smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, forgive me! Do you know, I had forgotten all about
our money troubles," Elsa exclaimed. "Why don't you tell Geoff about
them, mamma? It's in a way hardly fair on him; for if he knew, it
<i>might</i> make him understand how wrong and selfish he is."</p>

<p>"I will tell him soon, but not just yet. I do not want to distract his
mind from his lessons, and I wish to be quite sure first. I think I should
wait till I hear from your great-uncle."</p>

<p>"And that will be&mdash;how long? It is how many weeks since Mr.
Norris first wrote that he was uneasy? About seven, I should say," said
Elsa.</p>

<p>"Quite that," said her mother. "It is the waiting that is so trying.
I can do nothing without Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot's advice."</p>

<p>That last sentence had been a familiar one to Mrs. Tudor's children
almost ever since they could remember. "Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot" had
been a sort of autocrat and benefactor in one, to the family. His opinions,
his advice had been asked on all matters of importance; his approval had
been held out to them as the highest reward, his displeasure as the
punishment most to be dreaded. And yet they had never seen him!</p>

<p>"I wish he would come home himself," said Elsa. "I think Geoff
would be much the better for a visit from him," she added, with a slight
touch of sharpness in her tone.</p>

<p>"Poor Geoff!" said her mother. "I suppose the truth is that very few
women know how to manage boys."</p>

<p>"I don't see that," said Elsie. "On the contrary, a generous-natured
boy is often more influenced by a woman's gentleness than by a man's
severity. It is just that, that I don't like about Geoff. There is a want
of generous, chivalrous feeling about him."</p>

<p>"No," said Frances. "I don't quite agree with you. I think it is
there, but somehow not awakened. Mamma," she went on, "supposing
our great-uncle did come home, would he be dreadfully angry if he
found out that we all called him 'Hoot-Toot'?"</p>

<p>"Oh no," said her mother, smiling; "he's quite used to it. Your father
told me he had had the trick nearly all his life of saying 'Hoot-toot,
hoot-toot!' if ever he was perplexed or disapproving."</p>

<p>"What a <i>very</i> funny little boy he must have been!" exclaimed both
the girls together.</p>

<h5>AN UNLOOKED-FOR ARRIVAL.</h5>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 75px;">
<img src="images/image010b.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="T" title="" />
</div>
<div class="unindent">he next few days were trying ones for all the Tudor family.
The mother was waiting anxiously for further news of the
money losses, with which, as her lawyers told her, she was
threatened; the sisters were anxious too, though, with the bright hopefulness
of their age, the troubles which distressed their mother fell much
more lightly on them: <i>they</i> were anxious because they saw <i>her</i> suffering.</div>

<p>Vicky had some misty idea that something was wrong, but she knew
very little, and had been forbidden to say anything to Geoff about the little
she did know. So that of the whole household Geoff was the only one
who knew nothing, and went on living in his Fool's Paradise of having
all his wants supplied, yet grumbling that he had nothing! He was in
a particularly tiresome mood&mdash;perhaps, in spite of themselves, it was
impossible for his sisters to bear with him as patiently as usual; perhaps
the sight of his mother's pale face made him dissatisfied with himself and
cross because he would not honestly own that he was doing nothing to
help and please her. And the weather was very disagreeable, and among
Geoff's many "hates" was a very exaggerated dislike to bad weather.
About this sort of thing he had grumbled much more since his return
from a long visit to some friends in the country the summer before, when
the weather had been splendid, and everything done to make him enjoy
himself, in consequence of which he had come home with a fixed idea that
the country was always bright and charming; that it was only in town
that one had to face rain and cold and mud. As to fog, he had perhaps
more ground for his belief.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see such beastly weather?" were his first words to
Vicky one evening when the good little sister had rushed to the door on
hearing Geoff's ring, so that his majesty should not be kept waiting an
unnecessary moment. "I am perfectly drenched, and as cold as ice. Is
tea ready, Vic?"</p>

<p>"Quite ready&mdash;at least it will be by the time you've changed your
things. Do run up quick, Geoff. It's a bad thing to keep on wet
clothes."</p>

<p>"Mamma should have thought of that before she sent me to a day-school,"
said Geoff. "I've a good mind just <i>not</i> to change my clothes,
and take my chance of getting cold. It's perfect slavery&mdash;up in the
morning before it's light, and not home till pitch dark, and soaked into
the bargain."</p>

<p>"Hadn't you your mackintosh on?" asked Vicky.</p>

<p>"My mackintosh! It's in rags. I should have had a new one
ages ago."</p>

<p>"Geoff! I'm sure it can't be so bad. You've not had it a year."</p>

<p>"A year. No one wears a mackintosh for a year. The buttons are
all off, and the button-holes are burst."</p>

<p>"I'm sure they can be mended. Martha would have done it if you'd
asked her," said Vic, resolving to see to the unhappy mackintosh herself.
"I know poor mamma doesn't want to spend any extra money just now."</p>

<p>"There's a great deal too much spent on Elsa and Frances, and all
their furbelows," said Geoff, in what he thought a very manly tone.
"Here, Vicky, help me to pull off my boots, and then I must climb up
to the top of the house to change my things."</p>

<p>Vicky knelt down obediently and tugged at the muddy boots, though
it was a task she disliked as much as she could dislike anything. She
was rewarded by a gruff "Thank you," and when Geoff came down again
in dry clothes, to find the table neatly prepared, and his little sister ready
to pour out his tea, he did condescend to say that she was a good child!
But even though his toast was hot and crisp, and his egg boiled to perfection,
Geoff's pleasanter mood did not last long. He had a good many
lessons to do that evening, and they were lessons he disliked. Vicky sat
patiently, doing her best to help him till her bedtime came, and he had
barely finished when Frances brought a message that he was to come
upstairs&mdash;mamma said he was not to work any longer.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="images/image019.jpg" width="250" alt="VICKY_TUGGED_AT_THE_MUDDY_BOOTS." />
"You have finished, surely, Geoff?" she said, when he entered the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>"If I had finished, I would have come up sooner. You don't suppose
I stay down there grinding away to please myself, do you?" replied the
boy, rudely.</p>

<p>"Geoff!" exclaimed his sisters, unwisely, perhaps.</p>

<p>He turned upon them.</p>

<p>"I've not come to have you preaching
at me. Mamma, will you speak to them?"
he burst out. "I hate this life&mdash;nothing
but fault-finding as soon as I show my
face. I wish I were out of it, I do! I'd
rather be the poorest ploughboy in the
country than lead this miserable life in
this hateful London."</p>

<p>He said the last words loudly, almost
shouting them, indeed. To do him justice, it
was not often his temper got so completely
the better of him. The noise he was making
had prevented him and the others from
hearing the bell ring&mdash;prevented them, too, from hearing, a moment or two
later, a short colloquy on the stairs between Harvey and a new-comer.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the latter; "I don't want you to announce me. I'll
do it myself."</p>

<p>Geoff had left the door open.</p>

<p>"Yes," he was just repeating, even more loudly than before, "I hate
this life, I do. I am grinding at lessons from morning to night, and
when I come home this is the way you treat me. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But a voice behind him made him start.</p>

<p>"Hoot-toot, young man," it said. "Hoot-toot, hoot-toot! Come, I say,
this sort of thing will never do. And ladies present! Hoot&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the "toot" was drowned in a scream from Mrs. Tudor.</p>

<p>"Uncle, dear uncle, is it you? Can it be you yourself? Oh, Geoff,
Geoff! he is not often such a foolish boy, uncle, believe me. Oh, how&mdash;how
thankful I am you have come!"</p>

<p>She had risen from her seat and rushed forward to greet the stranger,
but suddenly she grew strangely pale, and seemed on the point of falling.
Elsa flew towards her on the one side, and the old gentleman on the other.</p>

<p>"Poor dear!" he exclaimed. "I have startled her, I'm afraid. Hoot-toot,
hoot-toot, silly old man that I am. Where's that ill-tempered fellow
off to?" he went on, glancing round. "Can't he fetch a glass of water,
or make himself useful in some way?"</p>

<p>"I will," said Frances, darting forward. Geoffrey had disappeared, and
small wonder.</p>

<p>"I am quite right now, thank you," said Mrs. Tudor, trying to smile,
when Elsa had got her on to the sofa. "Don't be frightened, Elsa dear.
Nor you, uncle; it was just the&mdash;the start. I've had a good deal to
make me anxious lately, you know."</p>

<p>"I should think I did&mdash;those idiots of lawyers!" muttered the old man.</p>

<p>"And poor Geoff," she went on; "I am afraid I have not paid much
attention to him lately, and he's felt it&mdash;foolishly, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" said Uncle Hoot-Toot under his breath. "Strikes me he's
used to a good deal too much attention," he added as an aside to Elsa,
with a quick look of inquiry in his bright keen eyes.</p>

<p>Elsa could hardly help smiling, but for her mother's sake she restrained
herself.</p>

<p>"It will be all right now you have come home, dear uncle," Mrs.
Tudor went on gently. "How was it? Had you started before you
got my letters? Why did you not let us know?"</p>

<p>"I was on the point of writing to announce my departure," said the
old gentleman, "when your letter came. It struck me then that I could
get home nearly as quickly as a letter, and so I thought it was no use
writing."</p>

<p>"Then you know&mdash;you know all about this bad news?" said Mrs.
Tudor falteringly.</p>

<p>"Yes; those fellows wrote to me. <i>That</i> was right enough; but what
they meant by worrying you about it, my dear, I can't conceive. It was
quite against all my orders. What did poor Frank make me your trustee
for, if it wasn't to manage these things for you?"</p>

<p>"Then you think, you hope, there may be something left to manage,
do you?" asked Mrs. Tudor, eagerly. "I have been anticipating the
very worst. I did not quite like to put it in words to these poor
children"&mdash;and she looked up affectionately at the two girls; "but I
have really been trying to make up my mind to our being quite
ruined."</p>

<p>"Hoot-toot, hoot-toot!" said her uncle. "No such nonsense, my dear.
I shall go to Norris's to-morrow morning and have it out with him.
Ruined! No, no. It'll be all right, you'll see. We'll go into it all, and
you have nothing to do but leave things to me. Now let us talk of
pleasanter matters. What a nice, pretty little house you've got! And
what nice, pretty little daughters! Good girls, too, or I'm uncommonly
mistaken. They're comforts to you, Alice, my dear, eh?"</p>

<p>"The greatest possible comforts," answered the mother, warmly.
"And so is little Vic. You haven't seen her yet."</p>

<p>"Little Vic? Oh, to be sure&mdash;my namesake." For Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot's
real name, you must know, was Mr. Victor Byrne. "To be sure;
must see her to-morrow; Vic, to be sure."</p>

<p>"And Geoffrey," Mrs. Tudor went on less assuredly. "Geoff is doing
very well at school. You will have a good report of him from his
masters. He is a steady worker, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But how about the <i>home</i> report of him, eh?" said Mr. Byrne, drily.
"There's two sides to most things, and I've rather a weakness for seeing
both. Never mind about that just now. I never take up impressions
hastily. Don't be afraid. I'll see Master Geoff for myself. Let's talk of
other things. What do these young ladies busy themselves about? Are
they good housekeepers, eh?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Tudor smiled.</p>

<p>"Can you make a pudding and a shirt, Elsa and Frances?" she asked.
"Tell your uncle your capabilities."</p>

<p>"I could manage the pudding," said Elsa. "I think the days for
home-made shirts are over."</p>

<p>"Hoot-toot, toot-toot!" said Mr. Byrne; "new-fangled notions, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, Great-Uncle Hoot&mdash;&mdash;" began Frances, eagerly. Then
blushing furiously, she stopped short.</p>

<p>The old gentleman burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"Never mind, my dear; I'm used to it. It's what they always called
me&mdash;all my nephews and nieces."</p>

<p>"Have you a great many nephews and nieces besides us?" asked
Elsa.</p>

<p>Mr. Byrne laughed again.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="images/image023.jpg" width="180" alt="MY_BLACKAMOOR." />
"That depends upon myself," he said. "I make
them, you see. I have had any quantity in my
day, but they're scattered far and wide. And&mdash;there
are a great many blanks, Alice, my dear,
since I was last at home," he added, turning to
Mrs. Tudor. "I don't know that any of them was
ever quite such a pet of mine as this little mother
of yours, my dears."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Elsa, looking rather disappointed;
"you are not our real uncle, then? I always
thought you were."</p>

<p>"Well, think so still," said Mr. Byrne. "At any
rate, you must treat me so, and then I shall be
quite content. But I must be going. I shall see you to-morrow after
I've had it out with that donkey Norris. What a stupid idiot he is, to
be sure!" and for a moment Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot looked quite fierce.
"And then I must see little Vic. What time shall I come to-morrow,
Alice?"</p>

<p>"Whenever you like, uncle," she said. "Will you not come and stay
here altogether?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you, my dear. I've got my own ways, you see. I'm a
fussy old fellow. And I've got my servant&mdash;my blackamoor. He'd
frighten all the neighbours. And you'd fuss yourself, thinking I wasn't
comfortable. I'll come up to-morrow afternoon and stay on to dinner,
if you like. And just leave the boy to me a bit. Good night, all of you;
good night."</p>

<p>
And in another moment the little old gentleman was gone.</p>

<p>The two girls and their mother sat staring at each other when he had
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Isn't it like a dream? Can you believe he has really come, mamma?"
said Elsa.</p>

<p>"Hardly," replied her mother. "But I am very thankful. If only
Geoff will not vex him."</p>

<p>Elsa and Frances said nothing. They had their own thoughts about
their brother, but they felt it best not to express them.</p>

</div>
<div class="unindent">s he like what you expected, Elsa?" asked Frances, when
they were in their own room.</div>

<p class="noindent">"Who? Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot? I'm sure I don't
know. I don't think I ever thought about what he'd be like."</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>had</i> an idea," said Frances. "Quite different, of course, from
what he really is. I had fancied he'd be tall and stooping, and with a big
nose and very queer eyes. I think I must have mixed him up with the
old godfather in the 'Nutcracker of Nuremberg,' without knowing it."</p>

<p>"Well, he's not so bad as that, anyway," said Elsa. "He looks rather
shrivelled and dried up; but he's so very neat and refined-looking. Did
you notice what small brown hands he has, and such <i>very</i> bright eyes?
Isn't it funny that he's only an adopted uncle, after all?"</p>

<p>"I think mamma had really forgotten he wasn't our real uncle," said
Frances. "Elsa, I am very glad he has come. I think poor mamma has
been far more unhappy than she let us know. She does look so ill."</p>

<p>"It's half of it Geoff," said Elsa, indignantly. "And now he must
needs spoil Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot's arrival by his tempers. Perhaps
it's just as well, however. 'By the pricking of my thumbs,' I fancy
Geoff has met his master."</p>

<p>"Elsa, you frighten me a little," said Frances. "You don't think he'll
be very severe with poor Geoff?"</p>

<p>"I don't think he'll be more severe than is for Geoff's good," replied
Elsa. "I must confess, though, I shouldn't like to face Great-Uncle
Hoot-Toot if I felt I had been behaving badly. How his eyes can
gleam!"</p>

<p>"And how he seemed to flash in upon us all of a sudden, and to
disappear almost as quickly! I'm afraid there's something a little bit
uncanny about him," said Frances, who was very imaginative. "But if
he helps to put all the money troubles right, he will certainly be like a
good fairy to us."</p>

<p>"Yes; and if he takes Geoff in hand," added Elsa. "But, Frances,
we must go to bed. I want to make everything
very nice to-morrow; I'm going to
think about what to have for dinner while
I go to sleep."</p>

<p>For Elsa was housekeeper&mdash;a very zealous
and rather anxious-minded young housekeeper.
Her dreams were often haunted by
visions of bakers' books and fishmongers' bills;
to-night curry and pilau chased each other
through her brain, and Frances was aroused
from her first sweet slumbers to be asked
if she would remember to look first thing to-morrow
morning if there was a bottle of
chutney in the store-closet.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="images/image026.jpg" width="230" alt="ELSA_WAS_HOUSEKEEPER." /></p>

<p>At breakfast Geoff came in, looking glum and slightly defiant. But he
said nothing except "Good morning." He started, however, a little,
when he saw his mother.</p>

<p>"Mamma," he said, "are you not well? You look so very pale."</p>

<p>The girls glanced up at this. It was true. They had not observed it
in the excitement of discussing the new arrival, and the satisfaction
of knowing it had brought relief to Mrs. Tudor's most pressing
anxieties.</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma dear. It is true. You do look very pale. Now, you
must not do anything to tire yourself all day. We will manage everything,
so that Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot shall see we are not silly useless
girls," said Elsa.</p>

<p>Geoffrey's lips opened as if he were about to speak, but he closed them
again. He was still on his high horse.</p>

<p>"Geoff," said his mother, as he was leaving, "you will dine with us
this evening. Try to get your lessons done quickly. Uncle will wish
to see something of you."</p>

<p>He muttered an indistinct "Very well, mamma," as he shut the door.</p>

<p>"Humph!" he said to himself, "I suppose Elsa will want to make him
think I'm properly treated. But <i>I</i> shall tell him the truth&mdash;any <i>man</i>
will understand how impossible it is for me to stand it any longer. I
don't mind if he did hear me shouting last night. There's a limit to
endurance. But I wish mamma didn't look so pale. Of course they'll
make out it's all <i>my</i> fault."</p>

<p>And feeling himself and his grievances of even more consequence than
usual, Master Geoff stalked off.</p>

<p>Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot made his appearance in the afternoon rather
earlier than he was expected. He found Mrs. Tudor alone in the
drawing-room, and had a talk with her by themselves, and then Vicky
was sent for, to make his acquaintance. The little girl came into the
drawing-room looking very much on her good behaviour indeed&mdash;so much
so that Elsa and Frances, who were with her, could scarcely help laughing.</p>

<p>"How do you do, my dear?" said her great-uncle, looking at her with
his bright eyes.</p>

<p>"Quite well, thank you," replied the little girl.</p>

<p>"Hoot-toot!" said the old gentleman; "and is that all you've got to
say to me?&mdash;a poor old fellow like me, who have come all the way from
India to see you."</p>

<p>Vicky looked up doubtfully, her blue eyes wandered all over Great-Uncle
Hoot-Toot's queer brown face and trim little figure. A red flush
spread slowly upwards from her cheeks to the roots of her fair hair, and
by the peculiar droop in the corners of her mouth, Elsa, who was nearest
her, saw that tears were not far off.</p>

<p>"What is it, Vicky dear?" she whispered. "What <i>will</i> he think of
the children? Geoff in a temper, and Vicky crying for nothing!" she
said to herself. "You are not frightened?" she added aloud.</p>

<p>"No," said Vicky, trying to recover herself. "It's only about Geoff.
I want to ask&mdash;<i>him</i>&mdash;not to be angry with Geoff."</p>

<p>"And why should I be angry with Geoff?" said the old gentleman, his
eyes twinkling. "Has he been saying so to you?"</p>

<p>"Oh no!" the little girl eagerly replied. "Geoff didn't say anything.
It was Harvey and Martha. They said they hoped he'd find his master
now <i>you'd</i> come, and that it was time he had some of his nonsense
whipped out of him. You won't whip him, will you? Oh, please, please
say you won't!" and she clasped her hands beseechingly. "Geoff isn't
naughty <i>really</i>. He doesn't mean to be naughty."</p>

<p>The tears were very near now.</p>

<p>"Hoot-toot, hoot-toot!" said Mr. Byrne. "Come, come, my little Vic;
I don't like this at all. So they've been making me out an ogre. That's
too bad. Me whip Geoff! Why, I think he could better whip me&mdash;a
strong, sturdy fellow like that. No, no, I don't want to whip him, I
assure you. But I'm glad to see Geoff's got such a good little sister, and
that she's so fond of him. He's not a bad brother to you, I hope? You
couldn't be so fond of him if he were."</p>

<p>"Oh no; Geoff's not naughty to me, scarcely <i>never</i>," said Vicky,
eagerly. "I'm sure he never wants to be naughty. It's just that
he's got some bad habits, of teasing and grumbling, and he can't
get out of them," she went on, with a little air of wisdom that was
very funny.</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Uncle Hoot-Toot, nodding his head. "Well, don't
you think it would be a very good thing if we could help him to get
out of them?"</p>

<p>Vicky looked up doubtfully again.</p>

<p>"If I think of some plan&mdash;something that may really do him good,
you'll trust your poor old uncle, won't you, my little Vic?"</p>

<p>She gave him a long steady stare.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said at last. Then with a sigh, "I would like Geoff to get
out of his tiresome ways."</p>

<p>And from this time Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot and Vicky were fast
friends.</p>

<p>Then he asked Elsa and Frances to go out a little walk with him.</p>

<p>"Is your mother always as pale as I have seen her?" he said abruptly,
almost as soon as they were alone.</p>

<p>Elsa hesitated.</p>

<p>"No," she said at last. "I'm afraid she is not at all well. Geoff
noticed it this morning."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed! Then he does notice things sometimes?" said Mr.
Byrne, drily.</p>

<p>"He's very fond of mamma," put in Frances.</p>

<p>"He takes a queer way to show it, it strikes me," remarked her
uncle.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's all his temper, I'm afraid," Frances allowed reluctantly.</p>

<p>"It is that he's spoilt," said Elsa. "He's perhaps not spoilt in one
way, but in another he is. He has never known any hardships or been
forced into any self-denial. Great-uncle," she went on earnestly, "if it's
true that we have lost or are going to lose nearly all our money, won't
it perhaps be a good thing for Geoff?"</p>

<p>"Who says you're going to lose your money?"</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly why I feel sure it's not coming right. I know
you said so to mamma&mdash;at least you tried to make her happier; but I
can't understand it. If that Mr. Norris wrote so strongly, there must be
something wrong."</p>

<p>Mr. Byrne moved and looked at her sharply.</p>

<p>"You don't speak that way to your mother, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Elsa; "I'm only too glad for her to feel happier
about it. I was only speaking of what I thought myself."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well&mdash;as long as your mother's mind is easier it doesn't matter.
I cannot explain things fully to you at present, but you seem to be sensible
girls, and girls to be trusted. I may just tell you this much&mdash;all this
trouble is nothing new; I had seen it coming for years. The only thing
I had not anticipated was that those fools of lawyers should have told
your mother about the crash when it did come. There was no need for
her to know anything about it. I'm her trustee&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But not legally," interrupted Elsa. "Mamma explained to us that
you couldn't be held responsible, as it was only like a friend that you had
helped her all these years."</p>

<p>"Hoot-toot, toot-toot!" he replied testily; "what difference does that
make? But never mind. I will explain all about it to you both&mdash;before
long. Just now the question is your mother. I think you will agree with
me when I say that it is plain to me that Master Geoff should leave home?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid mamma will be very much against it," said Elsa. "You
see, Geoff is a good boy in big things, and mamma thinks it is owing to
her having kept home influence over him. He's truthful and conscientious&mdash;he
is, indeed, and you must see I'm not inclined to take his part."</p>

<p>"But he's selfish, and bullying, and ungrateful. Not pretty qualities,
my dear, or likely to make a good foundation for a man's after-life. I'm
not going to send him to a grand boarding-school, however&mdash;that I
promise you, for I think it would be the ruin of him. Whatever I may
do to save your mother, I don't see but that Master Geoff should face
his true position."</p>

<p>"And we too, great-uncle," said Frances, eagerly. "Elsa and I are
quite ready to work; we've thought of several plans already."</p>

<p>"I quite believe you, my dear," said Mr. Byrne, approvingly. "You
shall tell me your plans some time soon, and I will tell you mine. No
fear but that you shall have work to do."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;&mdash;" began Elsa, but then she hesitated. "I was going to ask
you not to decide anything about Geoff till you have seen more of him.
If Frances and I could earn enough to keep him at school as he is, so that
mamma could have the comf&mdash;&mdash; No, I'm afraid I can't honestly say that
having Geoff at home would be any comfort to her&mdash;less than ever if
Frances and I were away. Great-uncle, don't you think Geoff should have
some idea of all this?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. But I cannot risk his teasing your mother. We will wait
a few days. I should like to see poor Alice looking better; and I shall
judge of Geoff for myself, my dears."</p>

<p>They were just at home again by this time. Vicky met them at the
door. She was in great excitement about Mr. Byrne's Indian servant,
who had come with his master's evening clothes.</p>

<p>"I was watching for Geoff, to tell him!" she exclaimed. "But my tea's
ready; I must go." And off she ran.</p>

<p>"Good little girl," said Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot, nodding his head
approvingly. "No grumbling from <i>her</i>, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, never," said Elsa, warmly. "She's having her tea alone to-day.
Geoff's coming in to dinner in your honour."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said the old gentleman.</p>

<h5>A CRISIS.</h5>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 75px;">
<img src="images/image033.jpg" width="65" height="65" alt="M" title="" />
</div>
<div class="unindent">Mrs. Tudor and the two girls had gone upstairs to the
drawing-room. Geoff glanced dubiously at Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot.</div>

<p class="noindent">"Shall I&mdash;shall I stay with you, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>Geoff was on his good behaviour.</p>

<p>The old gentleman glanced at him.</p>

<p>"Certainly, my boy, if you've nothing better to do," he said. "No
lessons&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," Geoff replied. "I've got all done, except a little I can do
in the morning."</p>

<p>"They work you pretty hard, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they do. There's not much fun for a fellow who's at school in
London. It's pretty much the same story&mdash;grind, grind, from one week's
end to another."</p>

<p>"Hoot-toot! That sounds melancholy," said Mr. Byrne. "No
holidays, eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, I've some holidays," said Geoff. "But, you see, when
a fellow has only got a mother and sisters&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Only</i>," repeated the old gentleman; but Geoff detected no sarcasm
in his tone.</p>

<p>"And mother's afraid of my skating, or boating on the river, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Doesn't she let you go in for the school games?" interrupted Mr.
Byrne again.</p>

<p>"Oh yes; it would be too silly not to do <i>that</i>. I told her at the
beginning&mdash;I mean, she understood&mdash;it wouldn't do. But there's lots of
things I'd like to do, if mother wasn't afraid. I should like to ride,
or at least to have a tricycle. It's about the only thing to make life
bearable in this horrible place. Such weather! I do hate London!"</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Mr. Byrne. "It's a pity your mother didn't consult
you before settling here."</p>

<p>"She did it for the best, I suppose," said Geoff. "She didn't want to
part with me, you see. But I'd rather have been at a boarding-school in
the country; I do so detest London. And then it's not pleasant to be
too poor to have things one should have at a public school."</p>

<p>"What may those be?" inquired the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"Oh, heaps of things. Pocket-money, for one thing. I was telling
mother about it. I really should have more, if I'm to stay properly
at school. There's Dick Colethorne, where I was staying last holidays&mdash;cousins
of ours; he has six times what I have, and he's only two years
older."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;is his mother a widow, and in somewhat restricted circumstances?" asked Mr. Byrne.</p>

<p>"Oh no," replied Geoff, unwarily. "His father's a very rich man;
and Dick is the only child."</p>

<p>"All the same, begging Mr. Colethorne's pardon, if he were twenty
times as rich as Cr&oelig;sus, I think he's making a tremendous mistake in
giving his boy a great deal of pocket-money," said Mr. Byrne.</p>

<p>"Well, of course, I shouldn't want as much as he has," said Geoff;
"but still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Geoffrey, my boy," said the old gentleman, rising as he spoke, "it
strikes me you're getting on a wrong tack. But we'll have some more
talk about all this. I don't want to keep your mother waiting, as I
promised to talk some more to <i>her</i> this evening. So we'll go upstairs.
Some day, perhaps, I'll tell you some of the experiences of <i>my</i> boyhood.
I'm glad, by-the-by, to see that you don't take wine."</p>

<p>"No-o," said Geoff. "That's one of the things mother is rather fussy
about. I'd like to talk about it with you, sir; I don't see but that at my
age I might now and then take a glass of sherry&mdash;or of claret, even. It
looks so foolish never to touch any. It's not that I <i>care</i> about it, you
know."</p>

<p>"At your age?" repeated Mr. Byrne, slowly. "Well, Geoff&mdash;do you
know, I don't quite agree with you. Nor do I see the fun of taking
a thing you 'don't care about,' just for the sake of looking as if
those who had the care of you didn't know what they were about."</p>

<p>They were half-way upstairs by this time. Geoff's face did not wear
its pleasantest expression as they entered the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"He's a horrid old curmudgeon," he whispered to Vicky; "I believe
Elsa's been setting him against me."</p>

<p>Vicky looked at him with reproachful eyes. "Oh, Geoff," she said, "I
do think he's so nice."</p>

<p>"You do, do you?" said he. "Well, I don't. I'll tell you what,
Vicky; I've a great mind to run away. I do so hate this life. I work
ever so much harder than most of the fellows, and I never get any thanks
for it; and everything I want is grudged me. My umbrella's all in rags,
and I'm ashamed to take it out; and if I was to ask mamma for a new
one, they'd all be down on me again, you'd see."</p>

<p>"But you haven't had it long, Geoff," said Vic.</p>

<p>"I've had it nearly a year. You're getting as bad as the rest, Vicky,"
he said querulously.</p>

<p>He had forgotten that he was not alone in the room with his little
sister, and had raised his tone, as he was too much in the habit of doing.</p>

<p>"Hoot-toot, hoot-toot!" said a now well-known voice from the other
side of the room; "what's all that about over there? You and Victoria
can't be quarrelling, surely?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Tudor looked up anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh no," said Vicky, eagerly; "we were only talking."</p>

<p>"And about what, pray?" persisted Mr. Byrne.</p>

<p>Vicky hesitated. She did not want to vex Geoff, but she was unused
to any but straightforward replies.</p>

<p>"About Geoff's umbrella," she said, growing very red.</p>

<p>"About Geoff's umbrella?" repeated the old gentleman. "What could
there be so interesting and exciting to say about Geoff's umbrella?"</p>

<p>"Only that I haven't got one&mdash;at least, mine's in rags; and if I say
I need a new one, they'll all be down upon me for extravagance," said
Geoff, as sulkily as he dared.</p>

<p>"My dear boy, don't talk in that dreadfully aggrieved tone," said his
mother, trying to speak lightly. "You know I have never refused you
anything you really require."</p>

<p>Geoffrey did not reply, at least not audibly. But Elsa's quick ears and
some other ears besides hers&mdash;for it is a curious fact that old people, when
they are not deaf, are often peculiarly the reverse&mdash;caught his muttered
whisper.</p>

<p>"Of course. Always the way if <i>I</i> want anything."</p>

<p>Mr. Byrne did not stay late. He saw that Mrs. Tudor looked tired
and depressed, and he did not wish to be alone with her to talk about
Geoff, as she probably would have done, for he could not have spoken of
the boy as she would have wished to hear.</p>

<p>A few days passed. Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot spent a part of each
with the Tudor family, quietly making his observations. Geoff certainly
did not show to advantage; and though his mother wore herself out with
talking to him and trying to bring him to a more reasonable frame of
mind, it was of no use. So at last she took Elsa's advice and left the
discontented, tiresome boy to himself, for perhaps the first time in his life.</p>

<p>And every evening, when alone with Victoria, the selfish boy entertained
his poor little sister with his projects of running away from a home
where he was so little appreciated.</p>

<p>But a change came, and that in a way which Geoffrey little expected.</p>

<p>One evening when Mr. Byrne said "Good night," it struck him that his
niece looked particularly tired.</p>

<p>"Make your mother go to bed at once, Elsa," he said, "I don't like
her looks. If she's not better to-morrow, I must have a doctor to see
her. And," he added in a lower tone still, "don't let Geoffrey go near
her to-morrow morning. Has he bothered her much lately?"</p>

<p>"Mamma has left him alone. It was much the best thing to do," Elsa
replied. "But all the same, I can see that it is making her very
unhappy."</p>

<p>"Time something should be done; that's growing very plain," said
Mr. Byrne. "Try and keep her quiet in the mean time, my dear. I
have nearly made up my mind, and I'll tell you all about it to-morrow."</p>

<p>Elsa felt rather frightened.</p>

<p>"Great-uncle," she said, "I don't want to make silly excuses for Geoff,
but it is true that he has never been quite so ill-natured and worrying
as lately."</p>

<p>"Or perhaps you have never seen it so plainly," said the old gentleman.
"But you needn't think I require to be softened to him, my dear;
I am only thinking of his good. He's not a bad lad at bottom; there's
good stuff in him. But he's ruining himself, and half killing your mother.
Life's been too easy to him, as you've said yourself. He needs bringing
to his senses."</p>

<p>Geoff slept soundly; moreover, his room was at the top of the house.
He did not hear any disturbance that night&mdash;the opening and shutting of
doors, the anxious whispering voices, the sound of wheels driving rapidly
up to the door. He knew nothing of it all. For, alas! his tiresome,
fidgety temper had caused him to be looked upon as no better than
a sort of naughty child in the house&mdash;of no use or assistance, concerning
whom every one's first thought in any trouble was, "We must manage
to get Geoff out of the way, or to keep him quiet."</p>

<p>When he awoke it was still dark. But there was a light in his
room&mdash;some one had come in with a candle. It was Elsa. He rubbed
his eyes and looked at her with a strange unreal feeling, as if he were
still dreaming. And when he saw her face, the unreal feeling did not go
away. She seemed so unlike herself, in her long white dressing-gown, the
light of the candle she was holding making her look so pale, and her eyes
so strained and anxious&mdash;<i>was</i> it the candle, or was she really so very pale?</p>

<p><img class="left" src="images/image038.jpg" width="320" alt="IT_WAS_ELSA." />"Elsa,"
he said sleepily, "what are you doing? What is the matter?
Isn't it dreadfully late&mdash;or&mdash;or early for you to be up?" he went on
confusedly.</p>

<p>"It's the morning," said Elsa, "but we haven't been in bed all night&mdash;Frances
and I. At least, we had only been in bed half an hour or so,
when we were called up."</p>

<p>"What was it?" asked Geoff, sleepily still. "Was the house on
fire?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Geoff, don't be silly!" said Elsa; "it's&mdash;it's much worse.
Mamma has been so ill&mdash;she is still."</p>

<p>Geoff started up now.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to go for the doctor?" he said.</p>

<p>"The doctor has been twice already, and he's coming back at nine
o'clock," she answered sadly. "He thought her a tiny bit better when
he came the last time. But she's very ill&mdash;she must be kept most <i>exceedingly</i>
quiet, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll get up now at once," said
Geoff; "I won't be five minutes,
Elsa. Tell mamma I'd have got
up before if I'd known."</p>

<p>"But, Geoff," said Elsa, firmly,
though reluctantly, "it's no use
your hurrying up for that. You
can't see her&mdash;you can't possibly
see her before you go to school,
anyway. The doctor says she is
to be kept <i>perfectly</i> quiet, and not
worried in any way."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't worry her, not when
she's ill," said Geoff, hastily.</p>

<p>"You couldn't help it," said Elsa. "She&mdash;she was very worried about
you last night, and she kept talking about your umbrella in a confused
sort of way now and then all night. We quieted her at last by telling her
we had given you one to go to school with. But if she saw you, even for
an instant, she would begin again. The doctor said you were not to go
into her room."</p>

<p>A choking feeling had come into Geoff's throat when Elsa spoke about
the umbrella; a very little more and he would have burst into tears of
remorse. But as she went on, pride and irritation got the better of him.
He was too completely unused to think of or for any one before himself,
to be able to do so all of a sudden, and it was a sort of relief to burst out
at his sister in the old way.</p>

<p>"I think you're forgetting yourself, Elsa. Is mamma not as much to
<i>me</i> as to you girls? Do you think. I haven't the sense to know how
to behave when any one's ill? I tell you I just will and shall go to see
her, whatever you say;" and he began dragging on his socks as if he were
going to rush down to his mother's room that very moment.</p>

<p>Elsa grew still paler than she had been before.</p>

<p>"Geoff," she said, "you must listen to me. It was for that I came up
to tell you. You must <i>not</i> come into mother's room. I'd do anything
to prevent it, but I can't believe that you'll force me to quarrel with you
this morning when&mdash;when we are all so unhappy. I don't want to make
you more unhappy, but I can't help speaking plainly to you. You <i>have</i>
worried mamma terribly lately, Geoff, and now you must bear the punishment.
It's&mdash;it's as much as her life is worth for you to go into her room
and speak to her this morning. I cannot allow it."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> allow it!" burst out Geoff. "Are you the head of the
house?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Elsa, "when mamma is ill, I consider that I am. And
what's more, Geoff, I have telegraphed to Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot. He
made me promise to do so if mamma were ill. I expect him directly.
It is past seven. Geoff, you had better dress and take your breakfast as
usual. I will come down and tell you how mamma is the last thing
before you go."</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> see mamma before I go to school," he replied sharply. "I
give you fair warning."</p>

<p>"Geoff," said Elsa, "you shall not."</p>

<p>And with these words she left the room.</p>
<p>"Humph!" said the old gentleman.</p>

</div>
<div class="unindent">eoff hurried on with his dressing. He was wretchedly unhappy&mdash;all
the more so because he was furiously angry with
Elsa, and perhaps, at the bottom of his heart, with himself.</div>

<p class="noindent">His room was, as I have said, at the top of the house. He did not
hear the front-door bell ring while he was splashing in his bath; and as
he rushed downstairs a quarter of an hour or so after Elsa had left him,
he was considerably taken aback to be met at the foot of the first flight
by the now familiar figure of Mr. Byrne.</p>

<p>"Geoffrey," he said quietly, "your sisters have gone to lie down and
try to sleep for a little. They have been up all night, and they are likely
to want all their strength. Go down to the school-room and get your
breakfast. When you have finished, I will come to talk to you a little
before you go to school."</p>

<p>Geoff glanced up. There was something in Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot's
face which made him feel there was no use in blustering or resisting.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said, putting as little expression in his voice as he
could; and as Mr. Byrne turned away, the boy made his way down to the
school-room.</p>

<p>It looked dreary and strange this morning. It was earlier than usual,
and perhaps the room had been less carefully done, for Mrs. Tudor's
illness had upset the whole household. The fire was only just lighted;
the preparations for Geoff's breakfast were only half ready. It was a very
chilly day; and as the boy sat down by the table, leaning his head on his
hands, he shivered both with cold and unhappiness.</p>

<p>"They all hate me," he said to himself. "I've known it for a long time,
but I've never been so sure of it before. It is much the best for me to
go away. Mamma <i>has</i> cared for me; but they're making her leave off,
and they'll set her entirely against me. She'll be far better and happier
without me; and when she gets well&mdash;I dare say they have exaggerated
her illness&mdash;they will have the pleasure of saying it's because I'm gone.
There's only Vic who'll really care. But she won't mind so very much,
either. I'll write to her now and then. I must think how best to do
about going away. I hate the sea; there's no use thinking of that. I
don't mind what I do, if it's in the country. I might go down to some
farmhouse&mdash;one of those jolly farms where Dick and I used to get a glass
of milk last summer. I wouldn't mind a bit, working on one of those
farms. It would be much jollier than grinding away at school. And I
am sure Dick and I did as much work as any haymakers last summer."</p>

<p>He had worked himself up into positively looking forward to the idea
of leaving home. Vague ideas of how his mother and sisters would learn
too late how little they had appreciated him; visions of magnanimously
forgiving them all some day when he should have, in some mysterious
way, become a landed proprietor, riding about his fields, and of inviting
them all down into the country to visit him, floated before his brain. He
ate his breakfast with a very good appetite; and when Mr. Byrne entered
the room, he was surprised to see no look of sulkiness on the boy's face;
though, on the other hand, there were no signs of concern or distress.</p>

<p>"Is he really <i>heartless</i>?" thought the old man, with a pang of disappointment.
"Am I mistaken in thinking the good material is there?"</p>

<p>"I want to talk to you, Geoff," he said. "You are early this morning.
You need not start for twenty minutes or more."</p>

<p>"Am I to understand you intend to prevent me seeing my mother,
sir?" said Geoff, in a peculiar tone.</p>

<p>Mr. Byrne looked at him rather sadly.</p>

<p>"It is not <i>I</i> preventing it," he said. "The doctor has left his orders."</p>

<p>"I understand," said Geoff, bitterly. "Well, it does not much matter.
Mother and the others are not likely to see much more of me."</p>

<p>The old gentleman looked at him sharply.</p>

<p>"Are you thinking of running away?" he said.</p>

<p>"Not running away," said Geoffrey. "I'm not going to do it in any
secret sort of way; but I've made up my mind to go. And now that
mother has thrown me over too, I don't suppose any one will care."</p>

<p>"You've not been going the way to make any one care, it strikes me,"
said Mr. Byrne. "But I have something to say to you, Geoff. One
thing which has helped to make your poor mother ill has been anxiety
about money matters. I had not wished her to know of it; but it was
told her by mistake. I myself have known for some time that things
were going wrong. But now the worst has come&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><img class="left" src="images/image042.jpg" width="280" alt="I_HAVE_SOMETHING_TO_SAY." />"What is the worst?" asked
Geoffrey. "Have we lost everything?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Byrne, "I think
that's about it."</p>

<p>"I think I should have been told
this before," said Geoff.</p>

<p>"Well," said his uncle, "I'm not
sure but that I agree with you. But
your mother wished to save you as
long as she could. And you have
not borne small annoyances so well
that she could hope for much comfort from you in a great trouble."</p>

<p>Geoff said nothing.</p>

<p>"I shall take care of your mother and sisters," Mr. Byrne went on.</p>

<p>"I am not even to be allowed to work for my mother, then?" said
Geoffrey.</p>

<p>"At your age it will be as much as you can do to work for yourself,"
said the old man. "And as yet, you cannot even do that directly. You
must go on with your education. I have found a school in the country
where you will be well taught, and where you will not be annoyed by not
being able to have all that your companions have, as you have so complained
about."</p>

<p>"And who is to pay for my schooling?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"I," replied Mr. Byrne.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Geoffrey. His tone was not exactly disrespectful,
but it was certainly not grateful. "I know I should thank you, but I
don't want you to pay schooling or anything else for me. I shall manage
for myself. It is much best for me to go away altogether. Even&mdash;even
if this about our money hadn't happened, I was already making up my
mind to it."</p>

<p>Mr. Byrne looked at him.</p>

<p>"Legally speaking, your mother could stop your leaving her,"
he said.</p>

<p>"She is not likely to do so," replied the boy, "if she is so ill that she
cannot even see me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said the old gentleman. "I will send my servant to
you at mid-day, to say how your mother is."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Geoffrey again.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Byrne left the room, and Geoff went off to school.</p>

<p>He was in a strange state of mind. He hardly took in what he had
been told of the state of his mother's money matters. He hardly indeed
believed it, so possessed was he by the idea that there was a sort of plot
to get rid of him.</p>

<p>"It isn't mother herself," he reflected. "It's all Elsa and Frances, and
that horrid old Hoot-Toot. But as for going to any school <i>he'd</i> send me
to&mdash;no, thank you."</p>

<p>He was standing about at noon with some of his companions, when the
coloured servant appeared.</p>

<p>"Please, sir," he said, "I was to tell you that the lady is better&mdash;doctor
say so;" and with a kind of salaam he waited to see what the young
gentleman would reply.</p>

<p>"All right," said Geoff, curtly; and the man turned to go.</p>

<p>Geoff did not see that at the gates he stood still a moment speaking to
another man, who appeared to have been waiting for him.</p>

<p>"That young gentleman with the dark hair. You see plain when I
speak to him," he said in his rather broken English.</p>

<p>The other man nodded his head.</p>

<p>"I shall know him again, no fear. Tell your master it's all right," he said.</p>

<p>Geoff had to stand some chaff from his friends on the subject of the
"darkey," of course. At another time he would rather have enjoyed it
than otherwise; but to-day he was unable to take part in any fun.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="images/image044.jpg" width="280" alt="HE STOOD STILL A MOMENT SPEAKING TO ANOTHER MAN." />"What
a surly humour Tudor's in!" said one of the boys to another.</p>

<p>Geoff overheard it, and glared at him.</p>

<p>"I shan't be missed here either, it seems," he said to himself.</p>

<p>He did not notice that evening, when he went home, that a respectable
unobtrusive-looking man, with the air of a servant out of livery, or something
of that kind, followed him all the way, only turning back when he
had seen the boy safe within his own
door. And there, just within, faithful
Vicky was awaiting him.</p>

<p>"I've been watching for you such a
time, Geoff dear," she said. "Mamma's
better. <i>Aren't</i> you glad? The doctor's
been again, just about an hour ago, and
he told me so as he went out."</p>

<p>"Have you seen her?" said Geoff,
abruptly.</p>

<p>Vicky hesitated. She knew her
answer would vex Geoff, and yet she
could not say what was not true.</p>

<p>"I've only <i>just</i> seen her," she said. "Elsa just took me in for a
moment. She has to be kept very, very quiet, Geoff. She'll have to
be very quiet for a long time."</p>

<p>"You may as well speak plainly," said her brother. "I know what
that means&mdash;I'm not to be allowed to see her for 'a very, very long time.'
Oh yes, I quite understand."</p>

<p>He was in his heart thankful to know that his mother was better, but
the relief only showed itself in additional ill-temper and indignation.</p>

<p>"Geoffrey dear, don't speak like that," said Vicky. "I wish I hadn't
gone in to see mamma if you couldn't, but I didn't like to say so to Elsa.
I know you didn't <i>mean</i> ever to vex mamma, and I'm sure you'll never
do it again, when she gets better, will you? Would you like me just to
run and tell Elsa and Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot how <i>dreadfully</i> you'd like
to see her just for a minute? If you just peeped in, you know, and said
'Good night, mamma; I am so awfully glad you're better!' that would
be better than nothing. Shall I, Geoff?"</p>

<p>"No," he replied gruffly. "I want to ask nothing. And I'm not sure
that I <i>do</i> want dreadfully to see her. Caring can't be all on one side."</p>

<p>Vicky's eyes were full of tears by this time.</p>

<p>"Oh, Geoff!" was all she could say. "Mamma not care for you!"</p>

<p>Her distress softened him a little.</p>

<p>"Don't <i>you</i> cry about it, Vic," he said. "I do believe <i>you</i> care for me,
anyway. You always will, won't you, Vicky?"</p>

<p>"Of course I shall," she sobbed, while some tears dropped into Geoff's
teacup. They were in the school-room by this time, and Vicky was at
her usual post.</p>

<p>"And some day," pursued Geoff, condescendingly, "perhaps we'll have
a little house of our own, Vicky, in the country, you know; we'll have
cocks and hens of our own, and always fresh eggs, of course, and strawberries,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cream," suggested Vicky, her eyes gleaming with delight at the
tempting prospect; "strawberries are nothing without cream."</p>

<p>"Of course," Geoff went on. "I was going to say cream, when you
interrupted me. We'd have a cream-cow, Vicky."</p>

<p>"A cream-cow," Vicky repeated. "What's that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know exactly. But one often reads of a milk-cow, so
I supposed there must be some cows that are all for cream, if some are
for milk. I'll find out all about it when&mdash;&mdash;" But he stopped short.
"Never mind, Vicky. When I have a little farm of my own, in the
country, I promise you I'll send for you to come and live with me."</p>

<p>"But you'll invite mamma and Elsa, and Francie too, Geoff; I wouldn't
care to come without them," objected Vicky.</p>

<p>"Mamma; oh yes, if she likes to come. Perhaps Elsa and Frances
will be married, and have houses of their own by then. I'm sure I
hope so."</p>

<p>He had talked himself and Vicky into quite good spirits by this time.
He was almost forgetting about his plan of running away. But it was
soon recalled to him. Elsa put her head in at the door.</p>

<p>"Vicky," she said, "you may come up to see mamma for a few minutes.
Come now, quick, before Geoff comes home, or else he will begin about
it again, and he just <i>must</i> not see her for some days. Mamma sees that
he must not."</p>

<p>Geoff's face grew dark.</p>

<p>"Elsa," Vicky called out appealingly. But Elsa had already disappeared.</p>

<p>And then Geoffrey <i>quite</i> made up his mind.</p>

<img src="images/image047.jpg" width="65" height="65" alt="H" title="" />
</div>
<div class="unindent">e was a sensible, practical enough boy in some ways. He
thought it all well over that night, and made what preparations
he could. He packed up the clothes he thought the
most necessary and useful in an old carpet-bag he found in the box-room,
and then he looked over his drawers and cupboards to see that all
was left in order, and he put together some things to be sent to him in
case he found it well to write for them.</div>

<p>Then he looked at his purse. He had, carefully stowed away, thirty
shillings in gold, and of his regular pocket-money a two-shilling piece,
a shilling, a threepenny bit, and some coppers. It was enough to take
him some hours' distance out of London, where he would be quite as
likely to find what he wanted, employment at some farmhouse, as farther
away.</p>

<p>He did not sleep much that night. He was so anxious to be off early
that he kept waking up every hour or two. At last, after striking a
match to see what o'clock it was for perhaps the twentieth time, his watch
told him it was past six. He got up and dressed, then he shouldered
his bag, and made his way as quickly as he could downstairs. He could
not resist lingering a moment outside his mother's door; it was slightly
ajar, and there was a faint light within. Elsa's voice came to him as he
stood there.</p>

<p>"I am <i>so</i> glad you are better this morning, dear mamma," she was
saying. "I hoped you would be when I went to bed, at three o'clock.
You were sleeping so peacefully. I am sure you will be quite well again
soon, if we can manage to keep you quiet, and if you won't worry yourself.
Everything is quite right."</p>

<p>Geoff's face hardened again.</p>

<p>"I know what all that means," he thought. "Yes, indeed, everything
is so right that I, <i>I</i>, have to run away like a thief, because I am too
miserable to bear it any more."</p>

<p>And he lingered no longer.</p>

<p>He made his way out of the house without difficulty. It was getting
light after a fashion by this time, though it was quite half an hour earlier
than he usually started for school. He felt chilly&mdash;chillier than he had
ever felt before, though it was not a very cold morning. But going out
breakfastless does not tend to make one feel warm, and of this sort of
thing Geoff had but scant experience. His bag, too, felt very heavy; he
glanced up and down the street with a vague idea that perhaps he would
catch sight of some boy who, for a penny or two, would carry it for him
to the omnibus; but there was no boy in sight. No one at all, indeed,
except a young man, who crossed the street from the opposite side while
Geoff was looking about him, and walked on slowly a little in front. He
was a very respectable-looking young man, far too much so to ask him to
carry the bag, yet as Geoff overtook him&mdash;for, heavy though it was, the
boy felt he must walk quickly to get off as fast as possible&mdash;the young
man glanced up with a good-natured smile.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," he said civilly, "your bag's a bit heavy for you.
Let me take hold of it with you, if we're going the same way."</p>

<p>Geoffrey looked at him doubtfully. He was too much of a Londoner
to make friends hastily.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said. "I can manage it. I'm only going to the
corner to wait for the omnibus."</p>

<p>"Just precisely what I'm going to do myself," said the other. "I'm
quite a stranger hereabouts. I've been staying a day or two with a
friend of mine who keeps a livery stable, and I'm off for the day to
Shalecray, to see another friend. Can you tell me, sir, maybe, if the
omnibus that passes near here takes one to the railway station?"</p>

<p>"Which railway station?" said Geoff, more than half inclined to
laugh at the stranger's evident countrifiedness.</p>

<p>"Victoria Station, to be sure. It's the one I come by. Isn't it the
big station for all parts?"</p>

<p>"Bless you! no," said Geoff. "There are six or seven as big as it in
London. What line is this place on?"</p>

<p><img class="right" src="images/image049.jpg" width="200" alt="WALKING ALONG BESIDE GEOFF." />"That's
more nor I can say," said the stranger, looking as if he
would have scratched his head to help him out of his perplexity if he had
had a hand free. But he had not, for he had caught up the bag, and
was walking along beside Geoff, and under his
arm he carried a very substantial alpaca umbrella.
And in the interest of the conversation Geoff
had scarcely noticed the way in which the
stranger had, as it were, attached himself to him.</p>

<p>"Ah, well! never mind. I'm going to Victoria
myself, and when we get there I'll look up your
place and find you your train," said Geoff,
patronizingly.</p>

<p>He had kept looking at the stranger, and as
he did so, his misgivings disappeared.</p>

<p>"He is just a simple country lad," he said to
himself. And, indeed, the young man's blue
eyes, fresh complexion, and open expression
would have reassured any but a <i>most</i> suspicious
person.</p>

<p>"You're very kind, sir," he replied. "You see, London's a big place,
and country folk feels half stupid-like in it."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," said Geoff. "For my part, I often wonder any one
that's free to do as they like cares to live in London. You're a great
deal better off in the country."</p>

<p>"There's bads and goods everywhere, I take it, sir," said the young
man, philosophically.</p>

<p>But by this time they had reached the corner where the omnibus
started, and Geoff's attention was directed to hailing the right one. And
an omnibus rattling over London stones is not exactly the place for
conversation, so no more passed between them till they were dropped
within a stone's throw of Victoria Station.</p>

<p>Geoff was beginning to feel very hungry, and almost faint as well as chilly.</p>

<p>"I say," he said to his companion, "you're not in any very desperate
hurry to get off, are you? For I'm frightfully hungry. You don't mind
waiting while I have some breakfast, do you? I'll look you out your
train for that place as soon as I've had some."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," said the stranger. "If it wouldn't be making too free,
I'd be pleased to join you. But I suppose you'll be going into the first-class?"</p>

<p>"Oh no," said Geoff. "I don't mind the second-class."</p>

<p>And into the second-class refreshment-room they went. They grew
very friendly over hot coffee and a rasher of bacon, and then Geoff laid
out threepence on a railway guide, and proceeded to hunt up Shalecray.</p>

<p>"Here you are!" he exclaimed. "And upon my word, that's a good
joke. This place&mdash;Shalecray&mdash;is on the very line I'm going by. I
wonder I never noticed it. I came up that way not long ago, from
Entlefield."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir; that's really curious," said the countryman. "And are
you going to Entlefield to-day?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Geoff, "I fancy so. I've not quite made up my mind, to
tell the truth. I know the country about there. I want to find some&mdash;some
farmhouse."</p>

<p>"Oh, exactly&mdash;I understand," interrupted the young man. "You want
somewhere where they'll put you up tidily for a few days&mdash;just for a
breath of country air."</p>

<p>"Well, no; not exactly," said Geoffrey. "The fact is, I'm looking out
for&mdash;for some sort of situation about a farm. I'm very fond of country
life. I don't care what I do. I'm not a fine gentleman!"</p>

<p>The countryman looked at him with interest.</p>

<p>"I see," he said. "You're tired of town, I take it, sir. But what do
your friends say to it, sir? At sixteen, or even seventeen, you have still
to ask leave, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Not always," said Geoff. "I've made no secret of it. I've no father,
and&mdash;I'm pretty much my own master."</p>

<p>"'I care for nobody, and nobody cares for me,' eh?" quoted the young
man, laughing.</p>

<p>"Something like it, I suppose," said Geoff, laughing too, though rather
forcedly. For a vision of Vicky, sobbing, perhaps, over her lonely
breakfast, would come before him&mdash;of Elsa and Frances trying how to
break to their mother the news that Geoff had really run away. "They'll
soon get over it," he said to himself. "They've got that old curmudgeon
to console them, and I don't want to live on <i>his</i> money."</p>

<p>"Do you think I can easily find a place of some kind?" he went on,
after a pause.</p>

<p>The countryman this time did scratch his head, while he considered.</p>

<p>"How old may you be, sir? Sixteen or seventeen, maybe?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>"I'm not so much; I'm only fourteen," said Geoff, rather reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Really! now, who'd 'a' thought it?" said his new friend, admiringly.
"You'll be just the man for a country life when you're full-grown. Not
afraid of roughing it? Fond of riding, I dare say?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Geoff. "At least, in town of course I haven't had as
much of it as I'd like." He had never ridden in his life, except the
previous summer, on a peculiarly gentle old pony of Mrs. Colethorne's.</p>

<p>"No, in course not. Well now, sir, if you'd no objection to stopping
at Shalecray with me, it strikes me my friend there, Farmer Eames,
might likely enough know of something to suit you. He's a very decent
fellow&mdash;a bit rough-spoken, maybe. But you're used to country ways&mdash;you'd
not mind that."</p>

<p>"Oh, not a bit!" said Geoff. "I'm much obliged to you for thinking
of it. And you say it's possible&mdash;that this Farmer Eames may perhaps
have a place that I should do for?"</p>

<p>"Nay, sir, I can't say that. It's just a chance. I only said he'd
maybe know of something."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't see that it will do any harm to ask him. I'll only
take a ticket to Shalecray, then. I can go on farther later in the day if I
don't find anything to suit me there. We'd better take the first train&mdash;a
quarter to nine. We've still twenty minutes or so to wait."</p>

<p>"Yes, there's plenty of time&mdash;time for a pipe. You don't object, sir?
But, bless me"&mdash;and he felt in his pockets one after the other&mdash;"if I
haven't forgotten my 'bacca! With your leave, sir, I'll run across the
street to fetch some. I saw a shop as we came in."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Geoff; "I'll wait here. Don't be too late."</p>

<p>He had no particular fancy for going to buy cheap tobacco in the
company of the very rustic-looking stranger. Besides, he thought it
safer to remain quiet in a dark corner of the waiting-room.</p>

<p>It was curious that, though the countryman came back with a well-filled
tobacco-pouch, he had not left the station! He only disappeared
for a minute or two into the telegraph office, and the message he there
indited was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Got him all safe. Will report further this evening."</p>

<p>And ten minutes later the two were ensconced in a third-class carriage,
with tickets for Shalecray.</p>

<p>Geoff had often travelled second, but rarely third. He did not, truth
to tell, particularly like it. Yet he could not have proposed anything else
to his companion, unless he had undertaken to pay the difference. And
as it was, the breakfast and his own third-class ticket had made a considerable
hole in his thirty shillings. He must be careful, for even with
all his inexperience he knew it was <i>possible</i> he might have to pay his own
way for some little time to come.</p>

<p>"Still, the chances are I shall find what I want very easily," he
reflected. "It is evidently not difficult, by what this fellow tells me."</p>

<p>It did not even strike him as in any way a very remarkable coincidence
that almost on the doorstep of his own home he should have lighted upon
the very person he needed to give him the particular information he was
in want of. For in many ways, in spite of his boasted independence,
poor Geoff was as innocent and unsuspicious as a baby.</p>

<h5>"HALF-A-CROWN A WEEK AND HIS VICTUALS."</h5>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 75px;">
<img src="images/image053b.jpg" width="65" height="65" alt="S" title="" />
</div>
<div class="unindent">halecray was a small station, where no very considerable
number of trains stopped in the twenty-four hours. It was
therefore a slow train by which Geoffrey Tudor and his new
friend travelled; so, though the distance from London was really short, it
took them fully two hours to reach their destination. And two hours
on a raw drizzly November morning is quite a long enough time to spend
in a third-class carriage, shivering if the windows are down, and suffering
on the other hand from the odours of damp fustian and bad tobacco if
they are up.</div>

<p>Cold as it was, it seemed pleasant in comparison when they got out at
last, and were making their way down a very muddy, but really country
lane. Geoff gave a sort of snort of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I do love the country," he said.</p>

<p>His companion looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>"I believe you, sir," he replied. "You must like it, to find it pleasant
in November," he went on, with a tone which made Geoff glance at him
in surprise. Somehow in the last few words the countryman's accent
seemed to have changed a little. Geoff could almost have fancied there
was a cockney twang about it.</p>

<p>"Why, don't <i>you</i> like it?" said Geoff. "You said you were lost and
miserable in town."</p>

<p>"Of course, sir. What else could I be? I'm country born and bred.
But it's not often as a Londoner takes to it as you do, and it's not to say
lively at this time, and"&mdash;he looked down with a grimace&mdash;"the lanes is
uncommon muddy."</p>

<p>"How far is it to your friend's place?" Geoff inquired, thinking to
himself that if <i>he</i> were to remark on the mud it would not be surprising,
but that it was rather curious for his companion to do so.</p>

<p>"A matter of two mile or so," Jowett&mdash;for Ned Jowett, he had told
Geoff, was his name&mdash;replied; "and now I come to think of it, perhaps
it'd be as well for you to leave your bag at the station. I'll see that it's
all right; and as you're not sure of stopping at Crickwood, there's no
sense in carrying it there and maybe back again for nothing. I'll give it
in charge to the station-master, and be back in a moment."</p>

<p>He had shouldered it and was hastening back to the station almost
before Geoff had time to take in what he said. The boy stood looking
after him vaguely. He was beginning to feel tired and a little dispirited.
He did not feel as if he could oppose anything just then.</p>

<p>"If he's a cheat and he's gone off with my bag, I just can't help it," he
thought. "He won't gain much. Still, he looks honest."</p>

<p>And five minutes later the sight of the young man's cheery face as he
hastened back removed all his misgivings.</p>

<p>"All right, sir," he called out. "It'll be quite safe; and if by chance
you hit it off with Mr. Eames, the milk-cart that comes to fetch the
empty cans in the afternoon can bring the bag too."</p>

<p>They stepped out more briskly after that. It was not such a very
long walk to the farm, though certainly more than the two miles Jowett
had spoken of. As they went on, the country grew decidedly pretty, or
perhaps it would be more correct to say one saw that in summer and
pleasant weather it must be very pretty. Geoff, however, was hardly at
the age for admiring scenery much. He looked about him with interest,
but little more than interest.</p>

<p>"Are there woods about here?" he asked suddenly. "I do like
woods."</p>

<p>Jowett hesitated.</p>

<p>"I don't know this part of the country not to say so very well," he
replied. "There's some fine gentlemen's seats round about, I believe.
Crickwood Bolders, now, is a fine place&mdash;we'll pass by the park wall in a
minute; it's the place that Eames's should by rights be the home farm
to, so to say. But it's been empty for a many years. The family died
down till it come to a distant cousin who was in foreign parts, and he let
the farm to Eames, and the house has been shut up. They do speak of
his coming back afore long."</p>

<p>Geoff looked out for the park of which Jowett spoke; they could not
see much of it, certainly, without climbing the wall, for which he felt no
energy. But a little farther on they came to gates, evidently a back
entrance, and they stood still for a moment or two and looked in.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="images/image055.jpg" width="260" alt="THEY STOOD STILL FOR A MOMENT OR TWO." />"Yes,"
said Geoff, gazing over the wide
expanse of softly undulating ground,
broken by clumps of magnificent old trees,
which at one side extended into a fringe
skirting the park for miles apparently,
till it melted in the distance into a range
of blue-topped hills&mdash;"yes, it must be a
fine place indeed. That's the sort of
place, now, I'd like to own, Jowett."</p>

<p>He spoke more cordially again, for
Jowett's acquaintance with the neighbourhood
had destroyed a sort of misgiving
that had somehow come over him
as to whether his new friend were perhaps
"taking him in altogether."</p>

<p>"I believe you," said the countryman, laughing loudly, as if Geoff's
remark had been a very good joke indeed. Geoff felt rather nettled.</p>

<p>"And why shouldn't I own such a place, pray?" he said haughtily.
"Such things, when one is a <i>gentleman</i>, are all a matter of chance, as you
know. If my father, or my grandfather, rather, had not been a younger
son, I should have been&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ned Jowett turned to him rather gravely.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to offend you, sir," he said. "But you must remember
you're taking up a different line from that. Farmer Eames, or farmer
nobody, wouldn't engage a farm hand that expected to be treated as a
gentleman. It's not my fault, sir. 'Twas yourself told me what you
wished."</p>

<p>Geoff was silent for a moment or two. It was not easy all at once to
make up his mind to <i>not</i> being a gentleman any more, and yet his
common sense told him that Jowett was right; it must be so. Unless,
indeed, he gave it all up and went back home again to eat humble pie,
and live on Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot's bounty, and go to some horrid
school of his choosing, and be more "bullied" (so he expressed it to
himself) than ever by his sisters, and scarcely allowed to see his mother
at all. The silent enumeration of these grievances decided him. He
turned round to Jowett with a smile.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "I was forgetting. You must tell Farmer Eames
he'll not find any nonsense about me."</p>

<p>"All right, sir. But, if you'll excuse me, I'd best perhaps drop the
'sir'?"</p>

<p>Geoff nodded.</p>

<p>"And that reminds me," Jowett went on, "you've not told me your
name&mdash;leastways, what name you wish me to give Eames. We're close
to his place now;" and as he spoke he looked about him scrutinizingly.
"Ten minutes past the back way through the park you'll come to a lane
on the left. Eames's farm is the first house you come to on the right," he
repeated to himself, too low for Geoff to hear. "Yes, I can't be wrong."</p>

<p>"You can call me Jim&mdash;Jim Jeffreys," said the boy. "He needn't be
afraid of getting into any trouble if he takes me on. I've no father, and
my mother won't worry about me," he added bitterly.</p>

<p>The entrance to the lane just then came in sight.</p>

<p>"This here's our way," said Jowett. "Supposing I go on a bit in
front. I think it would be just as well to explain to Eames about my
bringing you."</p>

<p>"All right," said Geoff. "I'll come on slowly. Where is the farm?"</p>

<p>"First house to the right; you can't miss it. But I'll come back to
meet you again."</p>

<p>He hurried on, and Geoff followed slowly. He was hungry now as
well as cold and tired&mdash;at least, he supposed he must be hungry, he felt
so dull and stupid. What should he do if Farmer Eames could not take
him on? he began to ask himself; he really felt as if it would be impossible
for him to set off on his travels again like a tramp, begging for work
all over the country. And for the first time it began faintly to dawn
upon him that he had acted very foolishly.</p>

<p>"But it's too late now," he said to himself; "I'd die rather than go
home and ask to be forgiven, and be treated by them all as if I deserved
to be sent to prison. I've got enough money to keep me going for a day
or two, anyway. If it was summer&mdash;haymaking-time, for instance, I
suppose it would be easy enough to get work. But now&mdash;&mdash;" and he
shivered as he gazed over the bare, dreary, lifeless-looking fields on all
sides, where it was difficult to believe that the green grass could ever
spring again, or the golden grain wave in the sunshine&mdash;"I really wonder
what work there can be to do in the winter. The ground's as hard as
iron; and oh, my goodness, isn't it cold?"</p>

<p>Suddenly some little way in front he descried two figures coming
towards him. The one was Jowett; the other, an older, stouter man,
must be Farmer Eames. Geoff's heart began to beat faster. Would he
be met by a refusal, and told to make his way back to the station? And
if so, where would he go, what should he do? It had all seemed so easy
when he planned it at home&mdash;he had felt so sure he would find what he
wanted at once; he had somehow forgotten it would no longer be summer
when he got out into the country again! For the first time in his life he
realized what hundreds, nay, thousands of boys, no older than he, must go
through every day&mdash;poor homeless fellows, poor and homeless through
no fault of their own in many cases.</p>

<p>"If ever I'm a rich man," thought Geoff, "I'll think of to-day."</p>

<p>And his anxiety grew so great that by the time the two men had come
up to him his usually ruddy face had become almost white.</p>

<p>Jowett looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>"You look uncommon cold, Jim," he said. "This 'ere's Jim Jeffreys
as I've been a-talking to you of, Mr. Eames," he said, by way of introduction
to the farmer.</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed!" Farmer Eames replied; "seems a well-grown lad, but
looks delicate. Is he always so white-like?"</p>

<p>"Bless you! no," said Jowett; "he's only a bit done up with&mdash;with one
thing and another. We made a hearly start of it, and it's chilly this
morning."</p>

<p>The farmer grunted a little.</p>

<p>"He'd need to get used to starting early of a morning if he was to be
any use to me," he said half-grudgingly. But even this sounded hopeful
to Geoff.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind getting up early," he said quickly. "I'm not used
to lying in bed late."</p>

<p>"There's early <i>and</i> early," said the farmer. "What I might take you
on trial for would be to drive the milk-cart to and fro the station. There's
four sendings in all&mdash;full and empty together. And the first time is for
the up-train that passes Shalecray at half-past five."</p>

<p>Geoff shivered a little. But it would not do to seem daunted.</p>

<p>"I'll be punctual," he said.</p>

<p>"And of course, between times you'd have to make yourself useful
about the dairy, and the pigs&mdash;you'd have to see to the pigs, and to make
yourself useful," repeated the farmer, whose power of expressing himself
was limited.</p>

<p>"Of course," agreed Geoff as heartily as he could, though, truth to
tell, the idea of pigs had not hitherto presented itself to him.</p>

<p>"Well," Farmer Eames went on, turning towards Jowett, "I dunno as
I mind giving him a trial, seeing as I'm just short of a boy as it happens.
And for the station work, it's well to have a sharpish lad, and a civil-spoken
one. You'll have to keep a civil tongue in your head, my boy&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Geoff, but not without a slight touch of haughtiness.
"Of course I'll be civil to every one who's civil to me."</p>

<p>"And who isn't civil to thee, maybe, now and then," said the farmer,
with a rather curious smile. "'Twon't be all walking on roses&mdash;nay,
'twon't be all walking on roses to be odd boy in a farm. But there's many
a one as'd think himself uncommon lucky to get the chance, I can tell you."</p>

<p>"Oh, and so I do," said Geoff, eagerly. "I do indeed. I think it's
awfully good of you to try me; and you'll see I'm not afraid of work."</p>

<p>"And what about his character?" said the farmer, speaking again to
Jowett. "Can you answer for his honesty?&mdash;that's the principal thing."</p>

<p>Geoff's cheeks flamed, and he was starting forward indignantly, when a
word or two whispered, sternly almost, in his ear by Jowett, forced him
to be quiet. "Don't be an idiot! do you want to spoil all your chances?"
he said. And something in the tone again struck Geoff with surprise.
He could scarcely believe it was the simple young countryman who was
speaking.</p>

<p>"I don't think you need be uneasy on that score," he said. "You see
it's all come about in a rather&mdash;uncommon sort of way."</p>

<p>"I should rather think so," said the farmer, shrugging his shoulders, but
smiling too.</p>

<p>"And," pursued Jowett, "you'll have to stretch a point or two. Of
course he'll want very little in the way of wages to begin."</p>

<p>"Half-a-crown a week and his victuals," replied the farmer, promptly.
"And he must bind himself for three months certain&mdash;I'm not going to
be thrown out of a boy at the orkardest time of the year for getting 'em
into sharp ways. And I can't have no asking for holidays for three
months, either."</p>

<p>Jowett looked at Geoff.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Geoff.</p>

<p>"And you must go to church reg'lar," added the farmer. "You can
manage it well enough, and Sunday school, too, if you're sharp&mdash;there's
only twice to the station on Sundays."</p>

<p>"On Sundays, too?" repeated Geoff. Sundays at worst had been a
day of no work at home.</p>

<p>"To be sure," said Eames, sharply. "Beasts can't do for themselves
on Sundays no more than any other day. And Londoners can't drink
sour milk on Sundays neither."</p>

<p>"No," said Geoff, meekly enough. "Of course I'm used to church,"
he added, "but I think I'm rather too old for the Sunday school."</p>

<p>"I'll leave that to the parson," said the farmer. "Well, now then, we
may as well see if dinner's not ready. It's quite time, and you'll be
getting hungry, Mr. Jowett," he added, with a slight hesitation.</p>

<p>"Why not call me Ned? You're very high in your manners to-day,
Eames," said the other, with a sort of wink.</p>

<p>Then they both laughed and walked on, leaving Geoff to follow.
Nothing was said about <i>his</i> being hungry.</p>

<p>"Perhaps <i>I</i> shall be expected to dine with the pigs," he thought.</p>

</div>
<div class="unindent">t was not quite so bad as that, however. Farmer Eames
turned in at the farmyard gate and led the two strangers into
a good-sized kitchen, where the table was already set, in a
homely fashion, for dinner. A stout, middle-aged woman, with a rather
sharp face, turned from the fire, where she was superintending some
cooking.</div>

<p>"Here we are again, wife," said Eames. "Glad to see dinner's ready.
Take a chair, Mr. Ned. You'll have a glass of beer to begin with?" and
as he poured it out, "This here's the new boy, missis&mdash;I've settled to give
him a trial."</p>

<p>Mrs. Eames murmured something, which Geoff supposed must have
been intended as a kind of welcome. She was just then lifting a large
pan of potatoes off the fire, and as she turned her face to the light, Geoff
noticed that it was very red&mdash;redder than a moment before. He could
almost have fancied the farmer's wife was shy.</p>

<p>"Shall I help you?" he exclaimed, darting forward to take hold of the
pan.</p>

<p>Eames burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"That's a good joke," he said. "He knows which side his bread's
buttered on, does this 'ere young fellow."</p>

<p>Geoff grew scarlet, and some angry rejoinder was on his lips, when
Jowett, who to his great indignation was laughing too, clapped him on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Come, my boy, there's naught to fly up about. Eames must have his
joke."</p>

<p>"I see naught to laugh at," said Mrs. Eames, who had by this time
shaken the potatoes into a large dish that stood ready to receive them;
"the lad meant it civil enough."</p>

<p>"You're not to spoil him now, wife," said her husband. "It's no
counter-jumpers' ways we want hereabouts. Sit thee down, Ned; and
Jim, there, you can draw the bench by the door a bit nearer the dresser,
and I'll give you some dinner by-and-by."</p>

<p>Geoff, his heart swelling, did as he was bid.
He sat quietly enough, glad of the rest and the
warmth, till Mr. and Mrs. Eames and their
guest were all helped, and had allayed the
first sharp edge of their appetites. But from
time to time the farmer's wife glanced at Geoff
uneasily, and once, he felt sure, he saw her
nudge her husband.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="images/image062.jpg" width="190" alt="HE SAT QUIETLY ENOUGH." />"She means to be kind," thought the boy.</p>

<p>And her kindness apparently had some effect.
The farmer looked round, after a deep draught
of beer, and pushed his tankard aside.</p>

<p>"Will you have a sup, Jim?" he said good-naturedly.
"I can't promise it you every day;
but for once in a way."</p>

<p>"No, thank you," Geoff replied. "I never
take beer; moth&mdash;&mdash;" but he stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>"As you like," said the farmer; "but though you're not thirsty, I dare
say you're hungry."</p>

<p>He cut off a slice of the cold meat before him, and put it on a plate
with some potatoes, and a bit of dripping from a dish on the table. The
slice of meat was small in proportion to the helping of potatoes; but Geoff
was faint with hunger. He took the plate, with the steel-pronged fork
and coarse black-handled knife, and sat down again by the dresser to eat.
But, hungry though he was, he could not manage it all. Half-way through,
a sort of miserable choky feeling came over him: he thought of his meals
at home&mdash;the nice white tablecloth, the sparkling glass and silver, the fine
china&mdash;and all seemed to grow misty before his eyes for a minute or two;
he almost felt as if he were going to faint, and the voices at the table
sounded as if they came from the other side of the Atlantic. He drank
some water&mdash;for on his refusing beer, Mrs. Eames had handed him a little
horn mug filled with water; <i>it</i> was as fresh and sweet as any he had ever
tasted, and he tried at the same time to swallow down his feelings. And by
the time that the farmer stood up to say grace, he felt pretty right again.</p>

<p>"And what are you going to be about, Eames?" said Jowett. "I'll
walk round the place with you, if you like. I must take the four train up
again."</p>

<p>"All right," the farmer replied; "Jim can take you to the station when
he goes to fetch the cans. You'll see that he doesn't come to grief on
the way. Do 'ee know how to drive a bit?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," replied Geoff, eagerly. "I drove a good deal last summer
at&mdash;in the country. And I know I was very fond of it."</p>

<p>"Well," said the farmer, drily, "you'll have enough of it here. But the
pony's old; you mustn't drive him too fast. Now, I'll tell one of the
men to show you the yard, and the pig-sties, and the missis'll show you
where she keeps the swill-tub. It'll want emptying&mdash;eh, wife?"</p>

<p>"It do that," she replied. "But he must change his clothes afore he
gets to that dirty work. Those are your best ones, ain't they?"</p>

<p>Geoff looked down at his suit. It was not his best, for he had left his
Eton jackets and trousers behind him. The clothes he had on were a
rough tweed suit he had had for the country; he had thought them very
far from best. But now it struck him that they did look a great deal too
good for feeding the pigs in.</p>

<p>"I've got an older pair of trousers in my bag," he said; "but this is
my oldest jacket."</p>

<p>"He should have a rougher one," said Mrs. Eames. "I'll look out;
maybe there's an old coat of George's as'd make down."</p>

<p>"All right," said Eames. "But you've no need of a coat at all to feed
the pigs in. Whoever heard o' such a thing?"</p>

<p>Just then a voice was heard at the door.</p>

<p>"I'm here, master," it said, "fur the new boy."</p>

<p>"All right," said Eames; and, followed by Geoff, in his shirt-sleeves by
this time, he led the way to the farmyard.</p>

<p>It was interesting, if only it had not been so cold. Matthew, the man,
was not very communicative certainly, and it seemed to the new boy that
he eyed him with some disfavour. Eames himself just gave a few short
directions, and then went off with Jowett.</p>

<p>"Them's the stables," said Matthew, jerking his thumb towards a row
of old buildings, "and them's the cow-houses," with a jerk the other way.
"Old pony's with master's mare, as he drives hisself. I've nought to
say to pony; it's your business. And I'll want a hand with cart-horses
and plough-horses. Young folks has no call to be idle."</p>

<p>"I don't mean to be idle," said Geoff; "but if Mr. Eames doesn't find
fault with me, <i>you</i>'ve no call to do so either."</p>

<p>He spoke more valiantly than he felt, perhaps, for Matthew's stolid face
and small, twinkling eyes were not pleasant. He muttered something,
and then went grumbling across the yard towards a wall, from behind
which emanated an odour which required no explanation.</p>

<p>"Them's pigs," said he. Matthew had a curious trick of curtailing his
phrases as his temper waxed sourer. Articles, prepositions, and auxiliary
verbs disappeared, till at last his language became a sort of spoken
hieroglyphics.</p>

<p>Geoff looked over the pig-sty wall. Grunt, grumph, snort&mdash;out they all
tumbled, one on the top of the other, making for the trough. Poor things!
it was still empty. Geoff could hardly help laughing, and yet he felt
rather sorry for them.</p>

<p>"I'll go and fetch their dinner," he said. "I don't mind pigs; but they
are awfully dirty."</p>

<p>"Ax the missus for soap to wash 'em," said Matthew, with a grin. He
hadn't yet made up his mind if the new boy was sharp or not.</p>

<p>"No," said Geoff, "I'll not do that till the first of April; but I'll tell you
what, Matthew, I'll not keep them as dirty as they are. And <i>I</i> should
say that the chap that's been looking after them is a very idle fellow."
Matthew scowled. "Pigs don't <i>need</i> to be so dirty," Geoff went on. "I
know at Cole&mdash;&mdash;" But he stopped abruptly. He was certainly not going
to take Matthew into his confidence. He asked to be shown the pony&mdash;poor
old pony! it didn't look as if it would be over "sperrity"&mdash;and then
he went back to the house to fetch the pigs' dinner.</p>

<p>Very hot, instead of cold, he was by the time he had carried across pail
after pail of Mrs. Eames's "swill," and emptied it into the barrel which
stood by the sty. It wasn't savoury work, either, and the farmer's wife
made a kind of excuse for there being so much of it. "Matthew were
that idle," and they'd been a hand short the last week or two. But Geoff
wasn't going to give in; there was a sort of enjoyment in it when it came
to the actual feeding of the pigs, and for their digestion's sake, it was well
that the farmer's wife warned him that there <i>might</i> be such a thing as
over-feeding, even of pigs. He would have spent the best part of the
afternoon in filling the trough and watching them squabble over it.</p>

<p>He was tired and hot, and decidedly dirtier-looking than could have
been expected, when Eames and Jowett came back from the fields.</p>

<p>"Time to get the pony to!" shouted the farmer. Geoff turned off to
the stable. He wanted to manage the harnessing alone; but, simple as it
was, he found it harder than it looked, and he would have been forced to
apply to Matthew, had not Jowett strolled into the stable. He felt sorry
for the boy, sorrier than he thought it well to show, when he saw his
flushed face and trembling hands, and in a trice he had disentangled the
mysteries of buckles and straps, and got all ready.</p>

<p>"Been working hard?" he said good-naturedly. "Seems a bit strange
at first."</p>

<p>"I don't mind the work; but&mdash;it does all seem very rough," said Geoff.</p>

<p>There was a slight quiver in his voice, but Jowett said no more
till they were jogging along on their way to the station. Geoff's spirits
had got up a little again by this time. He liked to feel the reins between
his fingers, even though the vehicle was only a milk-cart, and the steed a
sadly broken-winded old gray pony; and he was rather proud at having
managed to steer safely through the yard gate, as to which, to tell the
truth, he had felt a little nervous.</p>

<p>"Is there anything I can do for you on my way through town?" asked
Jowett. "I'll be in your part of the world to-night."</p>

<p>"Are you going to sleep at the livery stables?" asked Geoff.</p>

<p>Jowett nodded.</p>

<p>"I wish&mdash;&mdash;" began the boy. "If I'd thought of it, I'd have written
a letter for you to post in London. But there's no time now."</p>

<p>Jowett looked at his watch&mdash;a very good silver watch it was&mdash;"I don't
know that," he said. "I can get you a piece of paper and an envelope
at the station, and I'll see that your letter gets to&mdash;wherever it is, at
once."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Geoff. "And Jowett"&mdash;he hesitated. "You've been
very good to me&mdash;would you mind one thing more? There's some one
I would like to hear from sometimes, but I don't want to give my
address. Could I tell them&mdash;her&mdash;it's my sister&mdash;to write to your place,
and you to send it to me?"</p>

<p>"To be sure," said Jowett. "But I won't give my address in the
country. You just say to send on the letter to the care of</p>

<div class="smallcaps">
<p>
'Mr. Abel Smith,<br />
<span class="ind4">Livery Stables,</span><br />
<span class="ind6">Mowbray Place Mews</span>,'
</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and I'll see it comes straight to you. You won't want to give your name
maybe? Just put 'Mr. James, care of Abel Smith.'"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Geoff, with a sigh of relief. "You see," he went
on, half apologetically, "there's some one ill at home, and I'd like to know
how&mdash;how they are."</p>

<p>"To be sure," said Jowett again; "it's only natural. And however
bad one's been treated by one's people&mdash;and it's easy to see they
must have treated you <i>on</i>common badly to make a young gent like you
have to leave his home and come down to work for his living like a
poor boy, though I respects you for it all the more&mdash;still own folks is
own folks."</p>

<p>He cast a shrewd glance at Geoff, as he spoke. The boy could not
help colouring. Had he been treated so "oncommon badly"? Was his
determination to run away and be independent of Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot's
assistance a real manly resolution, or not rather a fit of ill-tempered
boyish spite? Would he not have been acting with far more true independence
by accepting gratefully the education which would have fitted
him for an honourable career in his own rank? for Mr. Byrne, as he knew
well by his mother's trust in the old gentleman, was not one to have
thrown him aside had he been worthy of assistance.</p>

<p>"But anyway, it's done now," thought the boy, choking down the
feelings which began to assert themselves.</p>

<p>At the station, Jowett was as good as his word. He got the paper and
a pencil, and Geoff wrote a short note to Vicky, just to tell her he was
"all right," and enclosing the address to which she was to write. And
Jowett undertook that she should have it that same evening. Had the
boy been less preoccupied he could not but have been struck by the
curious inconsistencies in the young countryman, who, when he had first
met him that morning, had seemed scarcely able to find his way to the
station, and yet, when occasion arose, had shown himself as sharp and
capable as any Londoner.</p>

<p>But as it was, when the train had whizzed off again, he only felt as if
his last friend had deserted him. And it was a very subdued and home-sick
Geoffrey who, in the chilly, misty autumn evening, drove the old
pony through the muddy lanes to the farm, the empty milk-cans rattling
in the cart behind him, and the tears slowly coursing down his cheeks
now there was no one to see them.</p>

</div>
<div class="unindent">e drove into the yard, where Matthew's disagreeable face and
voice soon greeted him. Half forgetting himself, Geoff threw
the reins on to the pony's neck and jumped out of the cart,
with his carpet-bag. He was making his way into the house, feeling as
if even the old bag was a kind of comfort in its way, when the farm-man
called him back.</div>

<p>"Dost think I's to groom pony?" he said ill-naturedly.
"May stand till doomsday afore I'll
touch him."</p>

<p><img class="left" src="images/image068c.jpg" width="180" alt="MATTHEW, THE MAN." /></p>

<p>Geoff turned back. Of course, he ought to
have remembered it was his work, and if Matthew
had spoken civilly he would even have thanked
him for the reminder&mdash;more gratefully, I dare say,
than he had often thanked Elsa or Frances for
a hint of some forgotten duty. But, as it was,
it took some self-control not to "fly out," and
to set to work, tired as he was, to groom the
pony and put him up for the night. It was all so
strange and new too; at Colethorne's he had
watched the stablemen at their work, and thought it looked easy and
amusing, but when it came to doing it, it seemed a very different thing,
especially in the dusk, chilly evening, and feeling as he did both tired and
hungry. He did his best, however, and the old pony was very patient,
poor beast, and Geoff's natural love of animals stood him in good stead;
he could never have relieved his own depression by ill temper to any
dumb creature. And at last old Dapple was made as comfortable as
Geoff knew how, for Matthew took care to keep out of the way, and to
offer no help or advice, and the boy turned towards the house, carpet-bag
in hand.</p>

<p>The fire was blazing brightly in the kitchen, and in front of it sat the
farmer, smoking a long clay pipe, which to Geoff smelt very nasty. He
coughed, to attract Mr. Eames's attention.</p>

<p>"I've brought my bag from the station," he said. "Will you tell me
where I'm to sleep?"</p>

<p>The farmer looked up sharply.</p>

<p>"You've brought the milk-cans back, too, I suppose? Your bag's not
the principal thing. Have you seen to Dapple?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Geoff, and his tone was somewhat sulky.</p>

<p>Eames looked at him again, and still more sharply.</p>

<p>"I told you at the first you were to keep a civil tongue in your head,"
he said. "You'll say 'sir' when you speak to me."</p>

<p>But just then Mrs. Eames fortunately made her appearance.</p>

<p>"Don't scold him&mdash;he's only a bit strange," she said. "Come with
me, Jim, and I'll show you your room."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the boy, gratefully.</p>

<p>Mrs. Eames glanced at her husband, as much as to say she was wiser
than he, and then led the way out of the kitchen down a short, flagged
passage, and up a short stair. Then she opened a door, and, by the
candle she held, Geoff saw a very small, very bare room. There was a
narrow bed in one corner, a chair, a window-shelf, on which stood a basin,
and a cupboard in the wall.</p>

<p>Mrs. Eames looked round. "It's been well cleaned out since last boy
went," she said. "Master and me'll look in now and then to see that
you keep it clean. Cupboard's handy, and there's a good flock mattress."
Then she gave him the light, and turned to go.</p>

<p>"Please," said Geoff, meekly, "might I have a piece of bread? I'm
rather hungry." It was long past his usual tea-time.</p>

<p>"To be sure!" she replied. "You've not had your tea? I put it
on the hob for you." And the good woman bustled off again.</p>

<p>Geoff followed her, after depositing his bag in the cupboard. She
poured out the tea into a bowl, and ladled in a good spoonful of brown
sugar. Then she cut a hunch off a great loaf, and put it beside the bowl
on the dresser. Geoff was so hungry and thirsty, that he attacked both
tea and bread, though the former was coarse in flavour, and the latter
butterless. But it was not the quality of the food that brought back
again that dreadful choking in his throat, and made the salt tears drop
into the bowl of tea. It was the thought of tea-time at home&mdash;the neat
table, and Vicky's dear, important-looking little face, as she filled his cup,
and put in the exact amount of sugar he liked&mdash;that came over him
suddenly with a sort of rush. He felt as if he could not bear it. He
swallowed down the tea with a gulp, and rammed the bread into his pocket.
Then, doing his utmost to look unconcerned, he went up to the farmer.</p>

<p>"Shall I go to bed now, please, sir?" he said, with a little hesitation
at the last word. "I'm&mdash;I'm rather tired."</p>

<p>"Go to bed?" repeated Eames. "Yes, I suppose so. You must
turn out early&mdash;the milk must be at the station by half-past five."</p>

<p>"How shall I wake?" asked Geoff, timidly.</p>

<p>"Wake? You'll have to learn to wake like others do. However, for
the first, I'll tell Matthew to knock you up."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Good-night, sir."</p>

<p>"Good-night." And the farmer turned again to the newspaper he was
reading.</p>

<p>"You'll find your bed well aired. I made Betsy see to that," called
out Mrs. Eames.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Geoff again, more heartily this time. But he overheard
Eames grumbling at his wife as he left the room, telling her "he'd
have none of that there coddling of the lad."</p>

<p>"And you'd have him laid up with rheumatics&mdash;dying of a chill?
That'd be a nice finish up to it all. You know quite well&mdash;&mdash;" But
Geoff heard no more. And he was too worn-out and sleepy to think
much of what he had heard.</p>

<p>He got out what he required for the night. He wondered shiveringly
how it would be possible to wash with only a basin. Water he was
evidently expected to fetch for himself. He tried to say his prayers, but
fell asleep, the tears running down his face, in the middle, and woke up
with a sob, and at last managed somehow to tumble into bed. It was
very cold, but, as Mrs. Eames had said, quite dry. The chilly feeling
woke him again, and he tried once more to say his prayers, and this time
with better success. He was able to add a special petition that "mother"
might soon be well again, and that dear Vicky might be happy. And then
he fell asleep&mdash;so soundly, so heavily, that when a drumming at the door
made itself heard, he fancied he had only just begun the night. He sat
up. Where was he? At first, in the darkness, he thought he was in
his own bed at home, and he wondered who
was knocking so roughly&mdash;wondered still more
at the rude voice which was shouting out&mdash;</p>

<p><img class="right" src="images/image071.jpg" width="220" alt="KNOCKING SO ROUGHLY." />"Up with you there, Jim, d'ye hear? I'm
not a-going to stand here all day. It's past
half-past four. Jim&mdash;you lazy lout. I'll call
master if you don't speak&mdash;a-locking of his
door like a fine gentleman!"</p>

<p>Gradually Geoff remembered all&mdash;the feeling
of the things about him&mdash;the coarse bed-clothes,
the slightly mildewy smell of the pillow, helped to
recall him to the present, even before he could see.</p>

<p>"I'm coming, Matthew!" he shouted back.
"I'll be ready in five minutes;" and out of bed
he crept, sleepy and confused, into the chilly
air of the little room. He had no matches, but there was a short curtain
before the window, and when he pulled it back the moonlight came
faintly in&mdash;enough for him to distinguish the few objects in the room.
He dared not attempt to wash, he was so afraid of being late. He
managed to get out his oldest pair of trousers, and hurried on his clothes
as fast as he could, feeling miserably dirty and slovenly, and thinking
to himself he would never again be hard on poor people for not being
clean! "I must try to wash when I come back," he said to himself.
Then he hurried out, and none too soon.</p>


<p>Matthew was in the yard, delighted to frighten him. "You'll have to
look sharp," he said, as Geoff hurried to the stable. "Betsy's filling the
cans, and rare and cross she is at having to do it. You should have
been there to help her, and the missis'll be out in a minute."</p>

<p>The harnessing of Dapple was not easy in the faint light, and he
could not find the stable lantern. But it got done at last, and Geoff led
the cart round to the dairy door, where Betsy was filling the last of the
cans. She was not so cross as she might have been, and Mrs. Eames
had not yet appeared. They got the cans into the cart, and in a minute
or two Geoff found himself jogging along the road, already becoming
familiar, to the station.</p>

<p>It seemed to grow darker instead of lighter, for the moon had gone
behind a cloud, and sunrise was still a good time off. Geoff wondered
dreamily to himself why people need get up so early in the country, and
then remembered that it would take two or three hours for the cans to
get to London. How little he or Vicky had thought, when they drank
at breakfast the nice milk which Mrs. Tudor had always taken care to
have of the best, of the labour and trouble involved in getting it there
in time! And though he had hurried so, he was only just at the station
when the train whizzed in, and the one sleepy porter growled at him for
not having "looked sharper," and banged the milk-cans about unnecessarily
in his temper, so that Geoff was really afraid they would break or
burst open, and all the milk come pouring out.</p>

<p>"You'll have to be here in better time for the twelve train," he said
crossly. "I'm not a-going to do this sort o' work for you nor no chap, if
you can't be here in time."</p>

<p>Geoff did not answer&mdash;he was getting used to sharp words and tones.
He nearly fell asleep in the cart as he jogged home again, and to add to
his discomfort a fine, small, chill, November rain began to fall. He
buttoned up his jacket, and wished he had put on his overcoat; and
then he laughed rather bitterly to think how absurd he would look with
this same overcoat, which had been new only a month before, driving old
Dapple in the milk-cart. He was wet and chilled to the bone when he
reached the farm, and even if he had energy to drive a little faster he
would not have dared to do so, after the farmer's warning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Eames was in the kitchen when, after putting up the cart and
pony, Geoff came in. There was a delicious fragrance of coffee about
which made his mouth water, but he did not even venture to go near the
fire. Mrs. Eames heard him, however, and looked up. She started a
little at the sight of his pale, wan face.</p>

<p>"Bless me, boy!" she exclaimed, "but you do look bad. Whatever's
the matter?"</p>

<p>Geoff smiled a little&mdash;he looked very nice when he smiled; it was only
when he was in one of his ill-tempered moods that there was anything
unlovable in his face&mdash;and his smile made Mrs. Eames still more sorry
for him.</p>

<p>"There's nothing the matter, thank you," he said; "I'm only rather
cold&mdash;and wet. I'm strange to it all, I suppose. I wanted to know
what I should do next. Should I feed the pigs?"</p>

<p>"Have you met the master?" said the farmer's wife. "He's gone
down the fields with Matthew and the others. Didn't you meet 'em?"</p>

<p>Geoff shook his head.</p>

<p>"No; I went straight to the stable when I came back from the
station."</p>

<p>"You'd better take off your wet jacket," she said. "There&mdash;hang it
before the fire. And," she went on, "there's a cup of coffee still hot, you
can have for your breakfast this morning as you're so cold&mdash;it'll warm you
better nor stir-about; and there's a scrap o' master's bacon you can eat
with your bread."</p>

<p>She poured out the coffee, steaming hot, and forked out the bacon
from the frying-pan as she spoke, and set all on the corner of the dresser
nearest to the fire.</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you awfully," said Geoff. Oh, how good the
coffee smelt! He had never enjoyed a meal so much, and yet, had it
been at home, <i>how</i> he would have grumbled! Coffee in a bowl, with
brown sugar&mdash;bread cut as thick as your fist, and no butter! Truly Geoff
was already beginning to taste some of the sweet uses of adversity.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, came the pigs. The farmer had left word that the sty
was to be cleaned out, and fresh straw fetched for the pigs' beds; and as
Betsy was much more good-natured than Matthew in showing the new
boy what was expected of him, he got on pretty well, even feeling a certain
pride in the improved aspect of the pig-sty when he had finished. He
would have dearly liked to try a scrubbing of the piggies themselves, if
he had not been afraid of Matthew's mocking him. But besides this there
was not time. At eleven the second lot of milk had to be carted to the
station, and with the remembrance of the cross porter Geoff dared not be
late. And in the still falling rain he set off again, though, thanks to
Mrs. Eames, with a dry jacket, and, thanks to her too, with a horse-rug
buckled round him, in which guise surely no one would have recognized
Master Geoffrey Tudor.</p>

<p>After dinner the farmer set him to cleaning out the stables, which it
appeared was to be a part of his regular work; then there were the pigs
to feed again, and at four o'clock the milk-cans to fetch. Oh, how tired
Geoff was getting of the lane to the station! And the day did not come
to an end without his getting into terrible disgrace for not having rinsed
out the cans with boiling water the night before, though nobody had told
him to do it. For a message had come from London that the cans were
dirty and the milk in danger of turning sour, and that if it happened again
Farmer Eames would have to send his milk elsewhere. It was natural
perhaps that he should be angry, and yet, as no one had explained about
it to Geoff, it seemed rather hard for him to have to take the scolding.
<i>Very</i> hard indeed it seemed to him&mdash;to proud Geoff, who had never yet
taken in good part his mother's mildest reprimands. And big boy though
he was, he sobbed himself to sleep this second night of his new life, for it
did seem too much, that when he had been trying his very best to please,
and was aching in every limb from his unwonted hard work, he should get
nothing but scolding. And yet he knew that he was lucky to have fallen
into such hands as Farmer Eames's, for, strict as he was, he was a fair and
reasonable master.</p>

<p>"I suppose," thought Geoff, "I have never really known what hardships
were, though I did think I had plenty to bear at home."</p>

<p>What would Elsa have said had she heard him?</p>

<h5>"HOOT-TOOT" BEHIND THE HEDGE.</h5>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 75px;">
<img src="images/image010b.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="T" title="" />
</div>
<div class="unindent">hat first day at the farm was a pretty fair specimen of those
that followed. The days grew into weeks and the weeks into
one month, and then into two, and Geoff went on with his self-chosen
hard and lonely life. The loneliness soon came to be the worst
of it. He got used to the hardships so far, and after all they were not
very terrible ones. He was better taken care of than he knew, and he
was a strong and healthy lad. Had he felt that he was working for
others, had he been cheered by loving and encouraging letters, he could
have borne it all contentedly. But no letters came, no answer to his
note to Vicky begging her to write; and Geoff's proud heart grew
prouder and, he tried to think, harder.</div>

<p>"They would let me know, somehow, I suppose, if there was anything
much the matter&mdash;if&mdash;mamma had not got much better yet." For even
to himself he would not allow the possibility of anything worse than her
not being "much better." And yet she had looked very ill that last
evening. He thought of it sometimes in the middle of the night, and
started up in a sort of agony of fright, feeling as if at all costs he must set
off there and then to see her&mdash;to know how she was. Often he did not
fall asleep again for hours, and then he would keep sobbing and crying
out from time to time, "Oh, mamma, mamma!" But there was no one to
hear. And with the morning all the proud, bitter feelings would come
back again. "They don't care for me. They are thankful to be rid of
me;" and he would picture his future life to himself, friendless and homeless,
as if he never had had either friends or home. Sometimes he
planned that when he grew older he would emigrate, and in a few years,
after having made a great fortune, he would come home again, a millionaire,
and shower down coals of fire in the shape of every sort of luxury upon
the heads of his unnatural family.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="images/image077.jpg" width="280" alt="SOBBING AND CRYING." />But these plans did not cheer him as they would have done some
months ago. His experiences had already made him more practical&mdash;he
knew that fortunes were not made nowadays in the Dick Whittington
way&mdash;he was learning to understand that not only are there but twenty
shillings in a pound, but, which concerned him more closely, that there
are but twelve pence in a shilling, and
only thirty in half-a-crown! He saw
with dismay the increasing holes in
his boots, and bargained hard with
the village cobbler to make him cheap
a rough, strong pair, which he would
never have dreamt of looking at in
the old days; he thanked Mrs. Eames
more humbly for the well-worn corduroy
jacket she made down for him
than he had ever thanked his mother
for the nice clothes which it had <i>not</i>
always been easy for her to procure
for him. Yes, Geoff was certainly
learning some lessons.</p>

<p>Sundays were in one way the worst, for though he had less to do, he
had more time for thinking. He went twice to church, where he
managed to sit in a corner out of sight, so that if the tears did sometimes
come into his eyes at some familiar hymn or verse, no one could see.
And no more was said about the Sunday school, greatly to his relief, for
he knew the clergyman would have cross-questioned him. On Sunday
afternoons he used to saunter about the park and grounds of Crickwood
Bolders. He liked it, and yet it made him melancholy. The house was
shut up, but it was easy to see it was a dear old place&mdash;just the sort of
"home" of Geoff's wildest dreams.</p>

<p>"If we were all living there together, now," he used to say to himself&mdash;"mamma
quite well and not worried about money&mdash;Elsa and Frances
would be so happy, we'd never squabble, and Vicky&mdash;&mdash;" But at the
idea of <i>Vicky's</i> happiness, words failed him.</p>

<p>It was, it must be allowed, a come-down from such beautiful fancies,
to have to hurry back to the farm to harness old Dapple and jog off to
the station with the milk. For even on Sundays people can't do without
eating and drinking.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="images/image078.jpg" width="280" alt="GEOFF STOOD STILL IN AMAZEMENT." />One Sunday a queer thing happened. He was just turning home, and
passing the lodge at the principal
entrance to the Hall, as it was
called, when behind the thick
evergreen hedge at one side; of
the little garden he heard voices.
They were speaking too low for
him to distinguish the words; but
one voice sounded to him very
like Eames's. It might be so,
for the farmer and the lodge-keeper
were friends. And Geoff
would have walked on without
thinking anything of it, had not
a sudden exclamation caught his
ear&mdash;"Hoot-toot, hoot-toot! I
tell you&mdash;&mdash;" But instantly the
voice dropped. It sounded as if some one had held up a warning finger.
Geoff stood still in amazement. <i>Could</i> Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot be there?
It seemed too impossible. But the boy's heart beat fast with a vague
feeling of expectation and apprehension mixed together.</p>

<p>"If he has come here accidentally, he must not see me," he said to
himself; and he hurried down the road as fast as he could, determined
to hasten to the station and back before the old gentleman, if it were he,
could get there. But to his surprise, on entering the farm-yard, the first
person to meet him was Mr. Eames himself.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, my lad?" he said good humouredly. "Thou'st
staring as if I were a ghost."</p>

<p>"I thought&mdash;I thought," stammered Geoff, "that I saw&mdash;no, heard
your voice just now at the lodge."</p>

<p>Eames laughed.</p>

<p>"But I couldn't be in two places at once, could I? Well, get off with
you to the station."</p>

<p>All was as usual of a Sunday there. No one about, no passengers by
the up-train&mdash;only the milk-cans; and Geoff, as he drove slowly home
again, almost persuaded himself that the familiar "Hoot-toot, hoot-toot!"
must have been altogether his own fancy.</p>

<p>But had he been at the little railway-station again an hour or two later,
he would have had reason to change his opinion. A passenger did start
from Shalecray by the last train for town; and when this same passenger
got out at Victoria, he hailed a hansom, and was driven quickly westward.
And when he arrived at his destination, and rang the bell, almost
before the servant had had time to open the door, a little figure pressed
eagerly forward, and a soft, clear voice exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, dear uncle, is that you at last? I've been watching for you such
a long time. Oh, do&mdash;do tell me about Geoff! Did you see him? And
oh, dear uncle, is he very unhappy?"</p>

<p>"Come upstairs, my pet," said the old man, "and you shall hear all
I can tell."</p>

<p>The three awaiting him in the drawing-room were nearly as eager as
the child. The mother's face grew pale with anxiety, the sisters' eyes
sparkled with eagerness.</p>

<p>"Did you find him easily, uncle? Was it where you thought?" asked
Vicky.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; I had no difficulty. I saw him, Vicky, but without his
seeing me. He has grown, and perhaps he is a little thinner, but he is
quite well. And I had an excellent account of him from the farmer.
He is working steadily, and bearing manfully what, to a boy like him,
cannot but be privations and hardships. But I am afraid he is very
unhappy&mdash;his face had a set sad look in it that I do not like to see on
one so young. I fear he never got your letters, Vicky. There must
have been some mistake about the address. I didn't want to push the
thing too far. You must write again, my little girl&mdash;say all you can to
soften him. What I want is that it should come from <i>his</i> side. He will
respect himself all his life for overcoming his pride, and asking to be
forgiven, only we must try to make it easy for him, poor fellow! Now
go to bed, Vicky, child, and think over what you will write to him
to-morrow. I want to talk it all over with your mother. Don't be
unhappy about poor old Geoff, my dear."</p>

<p>Obedient Vicky jumped up at once to go to bed. She tried to whisper
"Good night" as she went the round of the others to kiss them, but the words
would not come, and her pretty blue eyes were full of tears. Still, Vicky's
thoughts and dreams were far happier that night than for a long time past.</p>

<p>As soon as she had closed the door after her, the old gentleman turned
to the others.</p>

<p>"She doesn't know any more than we agreed upon?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," said Elsa; "she only knows that you got his exact address
from the same person who has told you about him from time to time.
She has no idea that the whole thing was planned and arranged by you
from the first, when you found he was set upon leaving home."</p>

<p>Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot nodded his head.</p>

<p>"That is all right. Years hence, when he has grown up into a good
and sensible man, we may, or if I am no longer here, <i>you</i> may tell him
all about it, my dears. But just now it would mortify him, and prevent
the lesson from doing him the good we hope for. I should not at all like
him to know I had employed detectives. He would be angry at having
been taken in. That Jowett is a very decent fellow, and did his part
well; but he has mismanaged the letters somehow. I must see him
about that. What was the address Geoff gave in his note to Vicky?
Are you sure she put it right?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Frances; "I saw it both times. It was&mdash;</p>

<div class="smallcaps">
<p>
To Mr. James,<br />
<span class="ind4">Care of Mr. Adam Smith,</span><br />
<span class="ind6">Murray Place Mews</span>.'"
</p>
</div>

<p>"Hoot-toot!" said Mr. Byrne. He could not make it out. But we,
who know in what a hurry Geoff wrote his note at the railway-station
while Jowett was waiting to take it, can quite well understand why
Vicky's letters had never reached him. For the address he <i>should</i> have
given was&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">"Abel Smith,</span><br />
<span class="ind4"><i>Mowbray</i></span> <span class="smallcaps">Place Mews</span>."
</p>

<p>"This time," Mr. Byrne went on, "I'll see that the letter is sent to him
direct. Jowett must manage it. Let Vicky address as before, and I'll
see that it reaches him."</p>

<p>"What do you think she should write?" said Mrs. Tudor, anxiously.</p>

<p>"What she feels. It does not much matter. But let her make him
understand that his home is open to him as ever&mdash;that he is neither
forgotten nor thought of harshly. If I mistake not, from what I saw
and what Eames told me, he will be so happy to find it is so, that all
the better side of his character will come out. And he will say more to
himself than any of us would ever wish to say to him."</p>

<p>"But, uncle dear," said Elsa, "if it turns out as you hope, and poor
Geoff comes home again and is all you and mamma wish&mdash;and&mdash;if <i>all</i>
your delightful plans are realized, won't Geoff find out everything you
don't want him to know at present? Indeed, aren't you afraid he may
have heard already that you are the new squire there?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Byrne. "Eames is a very cautious fellow; and from
having known me long ago, or rather from his father having known me
(it was I that got my cousin to give him the farm some years ago, as I
told you), I found it easy to make him understand all I wished. Crickwood
Bolders has stood empty so long, that the people about don't take
much interest in it. They only know vaguely that it has changed hands
lately, and Eames says I am spoken of as the new Mr. Bolders, and not
by my own name."</p>

<p>"I see," said Elsa.</p>

<p>"And," continued Mr. Byrne, "of course Geoff will take it for granted
that it was by the coincidence of his getting taken on at my place that we
found him out. It <i>was</i> a coincidence that he should have taken it into
his head to go down to that part of the country, through its being on the
way to Colethorne's."</p>

<p>"And you say that he is really working hard, and&mdash;and making the
best of things?" asked Mrs. Tudor. She smiled a little as she said it.
Geoff's "making the best of things" was such a <i>very</i> new idea.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot. "Eames gives him the best
of characters. He says the boy is thoroughly to be depended upon, and
that his work is well done, even to cleaning the pigs; and, best of all, he
is never heard to grumble."</p>

<p>"Fancy Geoff cleaning the
pigs!" exclaimed Elsa.</p>

<p>"I don't know that I find
<i>that</i> so difficult to fancy," said
Frances. "I think Geoff has
a real love for animals of all
kinds, and for all country
things. We would have sympathized
with him about it if
it hadn't been for his grumbling,
which made all his likes
and dislikes seem unreal. I
think what I pity him the
most for is the having to get
up so dreadfully early these
cold winter mornings. What
time did you say he had to get up, uncle?"</p>

<p><img class="left" src="images/image082.jpg" width="320" alt="VICKY WRITING THE LETTER." />"He
has to be at the station with the milk before five every morning,"
said the old gentleman, grimly. "Eames says his good woman is inclined
to 'coddle him a bit'&mdash;she can't forget who he really is, it appears. I
was glad to hear it; I don't want the poor boy actually to suffer&mdash;and
I don't want it to go on much longer. I confess I don't see that there
can be much 'coddling' if he has to be up and out before five o'clock in
the morning at this time of the year."</p>

<p>"No, indeed," said the girls. "And he must be <i>so</i> lonely."</p>

<p>"Yes, poor fellow!" said the old gentleman, with a sigh, "I saw that in
his face. And I was <i>glad</i> to see it. It shows the lesson is not a merely
surface one. You've had your wish for him to some extent, Elsa, my
dear. He has at last known some hardships."</p>

<p>Elsa's eyes filled with tears, though Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot had had
no thought of hurting her.</p>

<p>"Don't say that, please," she entreated. "I think&mdash;I am sure&mdash;I only
wanted him to learn how foolish he was, for his own sake more than for
any one's else even."</p>

<p>"I know, I know," the old gentleman agreed. "But I think he has
had about enough of it. See that Vicky writes that letter first thing
to-morrow."</p>

<h5>A LETTER AT LAST.</h5>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/image084b.jpg" width="65" height="65" alt="C" title="" />
</div>
<div class="unindent">hristmas had come and gone. It brought Geoff's home-sick
loneliness to a point that was almost unbearable. He
had looked forward vaguely to the twenty-fifth of December
with the sort of hope that it would bring him some message, some
remembrance, if it were but a Christmas card. And for two or three
days he managed to waylay the postman every morning as he passed the
farm, and to inquire timidly if there were no letter&mdash;was he <i>sure</i> there
was no letter for James Jeffreys? But the postman only shook his head.
He had "never had no letter for that name, neither with nor without
'care of Mr. Eames,'" as Geoff went on to suggest that if the farmer's
name had been omitted the letter might have been overlooked. And
when not only Christmas, but New Year's Day too was past and gone,
the boy lost hope.</div>

<p>"It is too bad," he sobbed to himself, late at night, alone in his bare
little room. "I think they might think a <i>little</i> of me. They might be
sorry for me, even&mdash;even if I did worry them all when I was at home.
They might guess how lonely I am. It isn't the hard work. If it was
for mother I was working, and if I knew they were all pleased with me,
I wouldn't mind it. But I can't bear to go on like this."</p>

<p>Yet he could not make up his mind to write home again, for as things
were it would be like begging for Mr. Byrne's charity. And every
feeling of independence and manliness in Geoff rose against accepting
benefits from one whose advice he had scouted and set at defiance. Still,
he was sensible enough to see that he could not go on with his present
life for long. "Work on a farm" had turned out very different from his
vague ideas of it. He could not, for years to come, hope to earn more
than the barest pittance, and he felt that if he were always to remain the
companion of the sort of people he was now among, he would not care to
live. And gradually another idea took shape in his mind&mdash;he would
emigrate! He saw some printed papers in the village post-office, telling
of government grants of land to able-bodied young men, and giving the
cost of the passage out, and various details, and he calculated that in a
year, by scrupulous economy, he might earn about half the sum required,
for the farmer had told him that if he continued to do well he would raise
his wages at the end of the first six months.</p>

<p>"And then," thought Geoff, "I might write home and tell them it was
all settled, and by selling all the things I have at home I might get the
rest of the money. Or&mdash;I would not even mind taking it as a <i>loan</i> from
Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot. That would seem different; and of course I do
owe him a great deal now, in a way, for he must be doing everything
for mother and the girls, and if only I were a man that would be my
business."</p>

<p>And for a while, after coming to this resolution, he felt happier. His
old dreams of making a great fortune and being the good genius of his
family returned, and he felt more interest in learning all he could of farm-work,
that might be useful to him in his new life. But these more
hopeful feelings did not last long or steadily; the pain of the home-sickness
and loneliness increased so terribly, that at times he felt as if he <i>could</i>
not bear it any longer. And he would probably, strong as he was, have
fallen ill, had not something happened.</p>

<p>It was about six weeks after the Sunday on which he had thought he
had overheard Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot's voice through the hedge. It
was a Sunday again. Geoff had been at church in the morning, and
after dinner he was sitting in a corner of the kitchen, feeling as if he had
no energy even to go for his favourite stroll in the grounds of the Hall,
when a sudden exclamation from Mrs. Eames made him look up. The
farmer's wife had been putting away some of the plates and dishes that
had been used at dinner, and in so doing happened to pull aside a
large dish leaning on one of the shelves of the high-backed dresser.</p>

<p>As she did so, a letter fell forward. It was addressed in a clear, good
hand to</p>

<div class="smallcaps">
<p>
"James Jeffreys,<br />
<span class="ind4">At Mr. Eames's</span>,<br />
<span class="ind6">Crickwood Farm</span>,<br />
<span class="ind8">Shalecray</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>"Bless me!" cried the good woman. "What's this a-doing here?
Jem, boy, 'tis thine. When can it have come? It may have been up
there a good bit."</p>

<p>Geoff started up and dashed forward with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"Give it me! oh, give it me, please!" he said, in an eager, trembling
voice. A look of disappointment crossed his face for a moment when he
saw the writing; but he tore the envelope open, and then his eyes
brightened up again. For it contained another letter, round which a slip
was folded with the words, "I forward enclosed, as agreed.&mdash;Ned Jowett."
And the second envelope was addressed to "Mr. James" in a round,
childish hand, that Geoff knew well. It was Vicky's.</p>

<p>He darted out of the kitchen, and into his own little room. He could
not have read the letter before any one. Already the tears were welling
up into his eyes. And long before he had finished reading they were
running down his face and dropping on to the paper. This was what
Vicky said, and the date was nearly six weeks old!</p>

<blockquote class="med">
<p>
"<span class="smallcaps">My Darling Geoff</span>,<br />

<span class="ind4">"Why</span> haven't you written to us? I wrote you a letter the minute I got your
little note with the address, and I have written to you again since then. Great-Uncle
Hoot-Toot says you are sure to get this letter. I think you can't have got the others. But
still you might have written. I have been so <i>very</i> unhappy about you. Of course I was
glad to hear you were getting on well, but still I have been <span class="smcap">very</span> unhappy. Mamma got
better very slowly. I don't think she would have got better if she hadn't heard that you
were getting on well, though. She has been very unhappy, too, and so have Elsa and
Frances, but poor Vicky most of all. We do so want you at home again. Geoff, I can't
tell you how good old Uncle Hoot-Toot is. There is something about money I can't
explain, but if you understood it all, you would see we should not be proud about his helping
us, for he has done more for us always than we knew; even mamma didn't. Oh, Geoff,
darling, do come home. We do all love you so, and mamma and Elsa were only troubled
because you didn't seem happy, and you didn't believe that they loved you. I think it
would be all different now if you came home again, and we do so want you. I keep your
room so nice. I dust it myself every day. Mamma makes me have tea in the drawing-room
now, and then I have a little pudding from their dinner, because, you see, one can't
eat so much at ladies' afternoon tea. But I was too miserable at tea alone in the school-room.
I have wrapped up our teapot, after Harvey had made it very bright, and I won't
ever make tea out of it till you come home. Oh, Geoffy, darling, do come home!
</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="ind4r">"Your loving, unhappy little</span><br />

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tears came faster and faster&mdash;so fast that it was with difficulty
Geoff could see to read the last few lines. He hid his face in his hands
and sobbed. He was only fourteen, remember, and there was no one to
see. And with these sobs and tears&mdash;good honest tears that he need not
have been ashamed of&mdash;there melted away all the unkind, ungrateful
feelings out of his poor sore heart. He saw himself as he had really
been&mdash;selfish, unreasonable, and spoilt.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said to himself, "that was all I <i>really</i> had to complain of.
They considered me too much&mdash;they spoilt me. But, oh, I would be so
different now! Only&mdash;I can't go home and say to Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot,
'I've had enough of working for myself; you may pay for me
now.' It would seem <i>too</i> mean. No, I must keep to my plan&mdash;it's too
late to change. But I think I might go home to see them all, and ask
them to forgive me. In three weeks I shall have been here three
months, and then I may ask for a holiday. I'll write to Vicky now at
once, and tell her so&mdash;I can post the letter when I go to the station.
They must have thought me <i>so</i> horrid for not having written before. I
wonder how it was I never got the other letters? But it doesn't matter
now I've got this one. Oh, dear Vicky, I think I shall nearly go out of
my mind with joy to see your little face again!"</p>

<p>He had provided himself, luckily, with some letter-paper and envelopes,
so there was no delay on that score. And once he had begun, he found
no difficulty in writing&mdash;indeed, he could have covered pages, for he
seemed to have so much to say. This was his letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smallcaps">My Dearest Vicky</span>,<br />

<span class="ind4">I</span> have only just got your letter, though you wrote it on the 15th of January.
Mrs. Eames&mdash;that's the farmer's wife&mdash;found it behind a dish on the dresser, where it has
been all the time. I never got your other letters; I can't think what became of them. I've
asked the postman nearly every day if there was no letter for me. Vicky, I can't tell you
all I'd like to say. I thought I'd write to mamma, but I feel as if I couldn't. Will you
tell her that I just <i>beg</i> her to forgive me? Not only for leaving home without leave, like
I did, but for all the way I went on and all the worry I gave her. I see it all quite plain.
I've been getting to see it for a good while, and when I read your dear letter it all came out
quite plain like a flash. I don't mind the hard work here, or even the messy sort of ways
compared to home&mdash;I wouldn't mind anything if I thought I was doing right. But it's the
loneliness. Vicky, I have thought sometimes I'd go out of my mind. Will you ask Great-Uncle
Hoot-Toot to forgive me, too? I'd like to understand about all he has done for us,
and I think I am much sensibler about money than I was, so perhaps he'll tell me. I can
ask for a holiday in three weeks, and then I'll come home for one day. I shall have to
tell you my plans, and I think mamma will think I'm right. I must work hard, and perhaps
in a few years I shall earn enough to come home and have a cottage like we planned.
For I've made up my mind to emigrate. I don't think I'd ever get on so well in anything
as in a country life; for, though it's very hard work here, I don't mind it, and I love animals,
and in the summer it won't be so bad. Please, Vicky, make everybody understand that
I hope never to be a trouble and worry any more.&mdash;Your very loving</p>

<p class="right">

<p>"P.S.&mdash;You may write here now. I don't mind you all knowing where I am."</p>

<p>By the time Geoff had finished this, for him, long epistle, it was nearly
dark. He had to hurry off to the station to be in time with the milk. He
was well known now by the men about the railway, and by one or two
of the guards, and he was glad to see one he knew this evening, as
he begged him to post his letter in town, for it was too late for the
Shalecray mail. The man was very good-natured, and promised to do
as he asked.</p>

<p>"By Tuesday," thought Geoff, "I may have a letter if Vicky writes at
once. And I might write again next Sunday. So that we'd hear of each
other every week."</p>

<p>And this thought made his face look very bright and cheery as he went
whistling into the kitchen, where, as usual of a Sunday evening, Eames
was sitting smoking beside the fire.</p>

<p>"The missis has told me about your letter, Jim," said the farmer.
"I'm right-down sorry about it, but I don't rightly know who to blame.
It's just got slipped out o' sight."</p>

<p>"Thank you," Geoff replied. "I'm awfully glad to have it now."</p>

<p>"He's never looked so bright since he came," said Mr. Eames to his
wife when Geoff had left the room. "He's about getting tired of it,
I fancy; and the squire's only too ready to forgive and forget, I take it.
But he's a deal o' good stuff in him, has the boy, and so I told the squire.
He's a fine spirit of his own, too."</p>

<p>"And as civil a lad as ever I seed," added Mrs. Eames. "No nonsense
and no airs. One can tell as he's a real gentleman. All the same, I'll
be uncommon glad when he's with his own folk again; no one'd believe
the weight it's been on my mind to see as he didn't fall ill with us. And
you always a-telling me as squire said he wasn't to be coddled and
cosseted. Yet you'd have been none so pleased if he'd got a chill
and the rheumatics or worse, as might have been if I hadn't myself seen
to his bed and his sheets and his blankets, till the weight of them on my
mind's been almost more nor I could bear."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said the farmer, soothingly, "all's well as ends well.
And you said yourself it'd never 'a' done for us to refuse the squire any
mortal service he could have asked of us."</p>

<div class="unindent">uesday brought no letter for Geoff&mdash;nor Wednesday, nor
even Thursday. His spirits went down again, and he felt
bitterly disappointed. Could his friend, the guard, have forgotten
to post the letter, after all? he asked himself. This thought kept
him up till Thursday evening, when, happening to see the same man at
the station, the guard's first words were, "Got any answer to your love-letter
yet, eh, Jim? I posted it straight away," and then Geoff did not
know what to think.</div>

<p>He did not like to write again. He began to fear that Vicky had
been mistaken in feeling so sure that his mother and Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot
and Elsa and Frances were all ready to forgive him, and longing
for his return. Perhaps they were all still too indignant with him to
allow Vicky to write, and he sighed deeply at the thought.</p>

<p>"I will wait till I can ask for a holiday," he said to himself, "and then
I will write and say I am coming, and if they won't see me I must just
bear it. At least, I am sure mother will see me when the time comes for
me to go to America, though it will be dreadful to have to wait till then."</p>

<p>When he got back to the house that evening, the farmer called to him.
<i>He</i> had had a letter that morning, though Geoff had not; and had it not
been getting dusk, the boy would have seen a slight twinkle in the good
man's eyes as he spoke to him.</p>

<p>"Jim, my boy," he said, "I shall want you to do an odd job or so of
work the next day or two. The new squire's coming down on Monday
to look round a bit. They've been tidying up at the house; did you
know?"</p>

<p>Geoff shook his head; he had no time for strolling about the Hall
grounds except on Sundays, and on the last Sunday he had been too
heavy-hearted to notice any change.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything of gardening?" the farmer went on.
"They're very short of hands, and I've promised to help what I could.
The rooms on the south side of the house are being got ready, and
there's the terrace-walk round that way wants doing up sadly. With
this mild weather the snowdrops and crocuses and all them spring flowers
is springing up finely; there's lots of them round that south side, and
Branch can't spare a man to sort them out and rake over the beds."</p>

<p>"I could do that," said Geoff, his eyes sparkling. "I don't know much
about gardening, but I know enough for that." It was a pleasant
prospect for him; a day or two's quiet work in the beautiful old garden;
he would feel almost like a gentleman again, he thought to himself.
"When shall I go, sir?" he went on eagerly.</p>

<p>"Why, the sooner the better," said Mr. Eames. "To-morrow morning.
That'll give you two good days. Branch wants it to look nice, for the
squire's ladies is coming with him. The south parlour is all ready.
There'll be a deal to do to the house&mdash;new furniture and all the rest
of it. He&mdash;the new squire's an old friend of mine and of my father's&mdash;and
a good friend he's been to me," he added in a lower voice.</p>

<p>"Are they going to live here?" asked Geoff. He liked the idea of
working there, but he rather shrank from being seen as a gardener's boy
by the new squire and "the ladies." "Though it is very silly of me,"
he reflected; "they wouldn't look at me; it would never strike them that
I was different from any other."</p>

<p>"Going to live here," repeated the farmer; "yes, of course. The new
squire would be off his head not to live at Crickwood Bolders, when it
belongs to him. A beautiful place as it is too."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Geoff, heartily, "it would be hard to imagine a more
beautiful place. The squire should be a happy man."</p>

<p>He thought so more and more during the next two days. There was
a great charm about the old house and the quaintly laid out grounds in
which it stood&mdash;especially on the south side, where Geoff's work lay.
The weather, too, was delightfully mild just then; it seemed a sort
of foretaste of summer, and the boy felt all his old love for the country
revive and grow stronger than ever as he raked and weeded and did his
best along the terrace walk.</p>

<p>"I wish the squire would make me his gardener," he said to himself
once. "But even to be a good gardener I suppose one should learn a
lot of things I know nothing about."</p>

<p>Good-will goes a long way, however.
Geoff felt really proud of his
work by Saturday evening, and on
Sunday the farmer took a look at
the flower-beds himself, and said he
had done well.</p>

<p>"Those beds over yonder look
rough still," he went on, pointing
to some little distance.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="images/image093.jpg" width="300" alt="THE FARMER TOOK A LOOK AT THE FLOWERBEDS HIMSELF." />
"They don't show from the house,"
said Geoff, "and Branch says it's
too early to do much. There will
be frosts again."</p>

<p>"No matter," said Mr. Eames;
"I'd like it all to look as tidy as
can be for Monday, seeing as I'd
promised to help. I'll give you
another day off the home-work, Jim. Robins's boy's very pleased to do
the station work."</p>

<p>Geoff looked up uneasily. It would be very awkward for him, very
awkward indeed, if "Robins's boy" were to do so well as to replace him
altogether. But there was a pleasant smile on the farmer's face, which
reassured him.</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," he said. "I'll do as you like, of course; but I don't
want any one else to do my own work for long."</p>

<p>"All right," said Eames. For a moment Geoff thought he was going
to say something more, but if so he changed his mind, and walked
quietly away.</p>

<p>Monday saw Geoff again at his post. It was a real early spring day,
and he could not help feeling the exhilarating influence of the fresh,
sweet air, though his heart was sad and heavy, for his hopes of a reply
from Vicky were every day growing fainter and fainter. There was
nothing to do but to wait till the time came for a holiday, and then to go
up to London and try to see them.</p>

<p>"And if they won't see me or forgive me," thought the boy with a sigh,
"I must just work on till I can emigrate."</p>

<p>He glanced up at the terrace as he thought this. He was working
this morning at some little distance from the house, but he liked to throw
a look every now and then to the beds which he had raked and tidied
already; they seemed so neat, and the crocuses were coming out so nicely.</p>

<p>The morning was getting on; Geoff looked at his watch&mdash;he had kept
it carefully, but he never looked at it now without a feeling that before
very long he might have to sell it&mdash;it was nearly twelve.</p>

<p>"I must go home to dinner, I suppose," he thought; and he began
gathering his tools together. As he did so, some slight sounds reached
him from the terrace, and, glancing in that direction, he saw that one of
the long windows opening on to it was ajar, and in another moment the
figures of two ladies could be seen standing just in the aperture, and
seemingly looking out as if uncertain what they were going to do.</p>

<p>"They have come," thought Geoff. "They'll be out here in another
instant. I can't help it if it <i>is</i> silly; I should <i>hate</i> ladies and gentlemen to
see me working here like a common boy;" and his face grew crimson
with the thought.</p>

<p>He hurried his things together, and was looking round to see if he
could not make his way out of the grounds without passing near the
house, when a quick pattering sound along the gravel startled him. A
little girl was running towards him, flying down the sloping path that led
from the terrace she came, her feet scarcely seeming to touch the ground,
her fair hair streaming behind.</p>

<p>"Oh!" was Geoff's first thought, "how like Vicky!"</p>

<p>But it was his first thought only, for almost before he had time to complete
it the little girl was beside him&mdash;<i>upon</i> him, one might almost say,
for her arms were round him, her sweet face, wet with tears of joy, was
pressed against his, her dear voice was speaking to him, "Oh, Geoffey,
Geoffey! My own Geoffey! It's I&mdash;it's your Vicky."</p>

<p>Geoff staggered, and almost fell. For a moment or two he felt so giddy
and confused he could not speak. But the feeling soon went away, and
the words came only too eagerly.</p>

<p>"How is it? Where have you come from? Do you know the new
squire? Where is mamma? Why didn't you write?"</p>

<p>And, laughing and crying, Vicky tried to explain. Did she know the
new squire? Could Geoff not guess? Where were they all? Mamma,
Elsa, Frances, Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot&mdash;where should they be, but in the
new squire's own house? Up there on the terrace&mdash;yes, they were all up
there; they had sent her to fetch him. And she dragged Geoff up with
her, Geoff feeling as if he were in a dream, till he felt his mother's and
sisters' kisses, and heard "the new squire's" voice sounding rather choky,
as he said, "Hoot-toot, hoot-toot! this will never do&mdash;never do, Geoff,
my boy."</p>

<p>They let Vicky explain it all in her own way. How Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot
had come home from India, meaning to take them all to live with
him in the old house which had come to be his. How disappointed he
had been by Geoff's selfish, discontented temper, and grumbling, worrying
ways, and had been casting about how best to give him a lesson which
should last, when Geoff solved the puzzle for him by going off of his own
accord.</p>

<p>"And," Vicky went on innocently, "was it not <i>wonderful</i> that you
should have come to uncle's own place, and got work with Mr. Eames,
whom he has known so long?" In which Geoff fully agreed; and it was
not till many years later that he knew how it had really been&mdash;how Mr.
Byrne had planned all for his safety and good, with the help of one of the
cleverest young detectives in the London police, "Ned Jowett," the
innocent countryman whom Geoff had patronized!</p>

<p>The boy told all he had been thinking of doing, his idea of emigrating,
his wish to be "independent," and gain his own livelihood. And his
mother explained to him what she herself had not thoroughly known till
lately&mdash;that for many years, ever since her husband's death, they had
owed far more to Great-Uncle Hoot-Toot than they had had any idea of.</p>

<p>"Your father was the son of his dearest friend," she said. "Mr. Byrne
has no relations of his own. We were left very poor, but he never let me
know it. The lawyers by mistake wrote to <i>me</i> about the loss of money,
which uncle had for long known was as good as lost, so that in reality it
made little difference. So you see, Geoff, what we owe him&mdash;<i>everything</i>&mdash;and
you must be guided by his wishes entirely."</p>

<p>They were kind and good wishes. He did not want Geoff to emigrate,
but he sympathized in his love for the country. For two or three years
Geoff was sent to a first-rate school, where he got on well, and then to an
agricultural college, where he also did so well that before he was twenty
he was able to be the squire's right hand in the management of his large
property, and in this way was able to feel that, without sacrificing his
independence, he could practically show his gratitude. They say that some
part of the estate will certainly be left to Geoff at Mr. Byrne's death; but
that, it is to be hoped, will not come to pass for many years yet, for the
old gentleman is still very vigorous, and the Hall would certainly not
seem itself at all if one did not hear his "Hoot-toot, hoot-toot!" sounding
here, there, and everywhere, as he trots busily about.</p>
